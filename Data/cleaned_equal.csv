I have emailed 4 times without the courtesy of a simple response from you.   This is disappointing from a company that is supposed to be faith based.   I need a refund of the $157.00 that you charged my visa on <DATE_TIME>.  I was then sent a blank book that I can't use.

Please send me a return label or whatever you need to do to live up to your refund policy.

PLEASE RESPOND and acknowledge receipt or I am going to notify Visa that I didn't not recieve the product for which I was charged - a DATED planner system.  All last year I was patient although I received each planner AT LEAST 2-4 weeks after the start date.  I simple cannot use an undated planner.

Thank you so much for your help.   I didn't really make an order, you just automatically billed my Visa $157.00 on <DATE_TIME>.  I assume it was for a <DATE_TIME> subscription like I had <DATE_TIME>.  Does that tell you what you need to know?   I hope so.   I didn't even receive an email, just a charge to my Visa.  I had no idea that <DATE_TIME> would be an undated book.

Customer's Message: Hello Friend

I really hate to send this email but I received the ""new"" Saintmaker Planner and I just can't make it work for me - I've tried.   What I liked about the system was the focus on the season with the <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME> calendars being dated.   Had I known it was going to a blank format I would not have allowed it to renew for <DATE_TIME>.  I just can't afford $157 dollars for something I can't use.  How can I get a refund to my credit card and make sure I'm not signed up for anything I the future.  If the design returns to the original format, please let me know.

I hope your other customers enjoy the new design.   I just can't.  I pray for your every success and blessings as we end <DATE_TIME> and move into the Epiphany in <DATE_TIME>.

Yours in Christ,

To order in the future, go to the Wholesale Portal first. The wholesale portal is found under the WHOLESALE tab in the top menu bar at

When you are in the portal, you can order from <LOCATION>, Bag hardware and <PERSON> Printed patterns.
IMPORTANT:
Be careful if you click in one of the product descriptions for hardware kits or other items because the links will navigate you away from the wholesale portal and onto the regular retail site! Example, to order <PERSON>, click the Hardware Kit <IN_PAN> in the menu, do not click on the links that are in the patterns <IN_PAN> or you will go to the hardware kits that are on the retail site!

If none of the earbud sizes work for you and the hearing aids are too large, you may try them without the earbuds. When doing this, please make sure to clean the hearing aids and replace the wax guards more regularly. Although the earbud makes the hearing aid more comfortable, it is not necessary for the hearing aids to function properly.

I want to write because I have issues with my evergreen devices. My order was number:

3532

Currently both hubs have a defect that they are not starting any more. Both front lends are not blinking any more. One of the hub was working <DATE_TIME> until i unplugged it in and re plugged it again. I think the sd cards got damaged after a power circle.

In addition my order was shipped without splitters and I tried powering the devices direct with the 2x psu power supplies. With contacting support I got to splitter shipped, but this was not because I have to pay import fees again for this to splitters and wanted a coupon for the next order. Anyway.

Is there a possibility to re flash the SD cards for the raspberry pi's? Is there a option to ssh into the hub's?

How can you help me fix my issues. Currently I am not able to do anything with my evergreen miners! Help please!

I recently purchased a portable sauna from your company. There was a promotion at that time ""if you purchased a portable sauna, you would also receive a free portable ice bath"". I received both my products and was very excited to start using them. I set up my portable ice bath shortly after I received it. I filled it with water/ice and used it.

When I came back to the ice bath <DATE_TIME>, half of the water was gone. I noticed there was significant leak along the drain tap.

We have loved our meadow. Now it is fading and many plants are leaning over on each other toward the ground.  Our question:  what next?  We understand to leave everything for the seeds to drop etc, but do we cut the plants off toward the bottom?  It is too dense to mow. Should we weed whack the area?
Or just what?  Advice greatly appreciated!
We eagerly await <DATE_TIME>!

","Hello <PERSON>,
It's great to hear that you're enjoying your meadow! As the season changes, it's normal for plants to start leaning and looking a bit tired. You can certainly cut back any plants that are falling over or looking unsightly. If it's too dense to mow, using a weed whacker or shears would work just fine. Just be sure to leave about 6 inches of growth so the plants can properly prepare for <DATE_TIME>.
Please let us know if we can be of further assistance and thank you for sharing these wonderful photos with us.

This is the second USPS shipment to me that has been lost in <DATE_TIME> (only one of those from <NRP> <PERSON>). You might consider using a more reliable shipper than USPS for time sensitive shipments like live plants (e.g. FedEx or UPS).

See attached photos. The outer box was intact, but inside much of the soil was dumped loose in the box, several pots were empty with dead plants just banging around loose in the box. The couple that are still green are in very poor condition and I doubt they will survive.

I think rather than trying to replace these plants at this time, I would prefer a refund for the damaged shipment. Maybe I’ll try again in the Spring.

Agent's Message: Hi Lafayette,
Thank you for reaching out, and we're sorry to hear about the charging issue with your watch.
To troubleshoot and resolve the problem, please try the following steps:
Check Charging Cable:
Ensure that the charging cable is securely connected to both the watch and the power source.
Inspect the cable for any damage, and if possible, try an alternate charging cable to rule out a faulty cable.
Power Source:
Try charging your watch from a different power source, such as a different USB port or an alternate charger.
Restart Your Watch:
Perform a restart on your watch. This can sometimes resolve minor issues.
Clean Charging Ports:
Inspect the charging ports on both the watch and the cable for any dirt or debris. Gently clean them using a soft, dry brush or compressed air.
If the issue persists after trying these steps, please let me know. Thanks again!

Yum!!
Great mix, doesn’t have any of that cooling effect you get with some mixes and no grittiness either with the almond flour mixes! Love it! Very versatile as well, made cookies with it!

I just received my package, but the purse strap I received is different than what was pictured on your website. Online, the strap shows that it comes with clips and D rings, but the strap I received does not have clips. I am repairing a purse, so the strap that was sent will not work.

It is possible to exchange this strap for the correct one?

“Forgotten” and reconnected the watch. That worked for <DATE_TIME> and the weather again stopped <IN_PAN>.

Turned off and on the watch. That didn’t do anything.

Via the app on my iPhone, I clicked and unclicked the weather <IN_PAN>. Nothing

Again, the watch is connected and communicating great in am other ways - but for some reason the weather will not connect and every time I go to it in the settings (on the watch) it simply says “watch isn’t paired” - and yet I cannot see where it isn’t paired! Because the app in the phone has it clicked to update

I have emailed 4 times without the courtesy of a simple response from you.   This is disappointing from a company that is supposed to be faith based.   I need a refund of the $157.00 that you charged my visa on <DATE_TIME>.  I was then sent a blank book that I can't use.

Please send me a return label or whatever you need to do to live up to your refund policy.

PLEASE RESPOND and acknowledge receipt or I am going to notify Visa that I didn't not recieve the product for which I was charged - a DATED planner system.  All last year I was patient although I received each planner AT LEAST 2-4 weeks after the start date.  I simple cannot use an undated planner.

I look forward to an immediate response.

I really hate to send this email but I received the ""new"" Saintmaker Planner and I just can't make it work for me - I've tried.   What I liked about the system was the focus on the season with the <DATE_TIME> and <DATE_TIME> calendars being dated.   Had I known it was going to a blank format I would not have allowed it to renew for <DATE_TIME>.  I just can't afford $157 dollars for something I can't use.  How can I get a refund to my credit card and make sure I'm not signed up for anything I the future.  If the design returns to the original format, please let me know.

I hope your other customers enjoy the new design.   I just can't.  I pray for your every success and blessings as we end <DATE_TIME> and move into the Epiphany in <DATE_TIME>.

What a kind offer. Thank you so much for the kind gesture of offering a gift card!
Because I didn’t hear back from anyone, I had to sort it myself. So I did manage to arrange the return in the end. I had to call DHL directly and ask them to assist me and they found a way around the problem.

The ring should be back with you by <DATE_TIME> according to the tracking.
In light of this, if you can still honour the gift card, I would love to use it to help by another ring in the right size. Or perhaps another item from your site.

I have just been to 3 different DHL drop off points to drop off the ring and the prepaid label you guys kindly sent for me, but each place said they can’t accept the return label. Apparently there is a problem with the system and it will only accept single barcode return labels not the double one…

Do you know what I can do about this? I realise its not your fault and the problem is clearly with DHL but might you have dealt with this problem before and know what I can do to solve it?

Thanks so much for getting back to me. I’m a little upset by your response as I sent an email asking for any potential extra fees and I was told that everything was included.

I will definitely re purchase the ring, however this £30 fee is enough for me to change my mind on this… what if the next one doesn’t fit? That’s £60 total just for returning… as on online purchase I don’t really understand how this is justifiable, as sizing is always an issue.

Especially as I asked about potential additional fees and wasn’t told about it…

The actual cereal is filing up less than 1/4 of the bag… it’s so deceiving and I just assumed it would be an actual full bag of cereal for the price I paid for it. Not to mention all 3 different cereals I bought taste exactly the same and are really crunchy… not in a good way. I’m not a fan and wouldn’t order again. I feel a bit ripped off unfortunately.

Agent's Message: Hello, your order has shipped and should be there within <DATE_TIME>!
Customer's Message: I filled out the RMA - any chance this will get sent out soon? The fan sound is pretty intense. Thanks
Agent's Message: Can you please fill out the RMA form for the defective fan?
<URL>
Customer's Message: Thanks, the fan in the Hub is making the noise and it's not being caused by cable contact as far as I can see.
A replacement would be great.

Would it be possible to also get a set of the footpads? And is there a version of the Hub case thatʻs opaque like the drive case? <PERSON> consider paying for that as an upgrade.
Agent's Message: It could be as simple as a cable errantly touching the fan. Whatever issues you had initially setting it up should not persist on powering it down. First step is to determine if it is the Evergreen Hub or the drive making noise, both have a fan. Whichever one is the source, power it down and remove the four footpads on the bottom. This exposes the phillips head screws. Remove this and inspect to see if a cable is touching a fan. If not the fan might be bad and if so we can send a replacement.
Customer's Message: My starter kit spent a long time in transit and I struggled to get it setup but itʻs been working for <DATE_TIME> now.
However starting <DATE_TIME> something in the kit is making a loud humming sound. Sounds like a drive problem (or fan, not sure there are any fans).
I donʻt see any obvious problems inspecting the info thatʻs surfaced in the app.
Iʻd rather not teardown the system since itʻs working but the noise is bothersome.
What course of action would you recommend?
","Hi there,

The larger fan is actually the better one. It's worth noting that instead of plugging the 2 pin cable into the old port, you'll want to affix it to the pins on the side of the device. The pins should be color-coded and you'll want to locate the pins in the corner with black and red, and plug in the 2 pins aligned to those colors. The fan should immediately turn on. If you need further assistance, please book a meeting where I can help you add it.

Customer's Message: Hi,

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly, I bought the discovery set and at the same time I purchased a voucher for a full sized bottle of my choice. I was checking how much was the voucher that I have now used which was purchased at the same time as the discover set.

Thank you,

<PERSON>
Agent's Message: Dear <PERSON>,
You did understand it right. Normally when you buy the Discovery Set you get a coupon for £25, but because you took advantage of this offer, you receive a £95 voucher to spend on your favourite fragrance. Therefore, the full bottle 100ml should be free for you.
Best regards,
Izzie Saltworks
Customer's Message: Dear Saltworks,

I am really delighted with the products you have sent me. When I ordered the new collection I purchased a voucher for a full sized bottle which I understood was an additional £39.

I ordered the Ill Rough full sized bottle, again I am delighted but can you confirm the price of the voucher please so I can check the amount charged is correct.

Many thanks,

<PERSON>
","Dear <PERSON>,

I apologize for any confusion. The special offer voucher you purchased on <DATE_TIME> as the Discovery Set was for £59, which was upgraded from a £25 voucher to a £95 voucher to be used towards a full-sized bottle.

Customer's Message: Hello,

It does not say <DATE_TIME> it says <DATE_TIME> so that already past whatever date any food or personal item is stamped with when you receive it is <DATE_TIME> it expires there is NO grace period AFTER the date. So if i received this package in <DATE_TIME> with the expire date being <DATE_TIME> that mean that the product is good through <DATE_TIME>. So if i am in <DATE_TIME> this product is <DATE_TIME> there is no grace period after that stating ok you can use this product <DATE_TIME> after the date.

I attached a picture to show you that you gave me one for <DATE_TIME> THATS expired not only that its past the 2year mark which means is <DATE_TIME> expired meaning in order for my product to be fresh someone would have to receive this product in exactly <DATE_TIME> then it would get thrown away <DATE_TIME> !

Hi,
re: order 59045; tracking: 1ZY8272X0396435008

We received our bagels, but the UPS driver delivered them next to our rural mail box which is just off a gravel road next to our driveway.  He has done this before.  I have a call into UPS since we've had other issues with this particular driver.

Can you ship using a different company other than UPS?  I'm getting tired of the antics of this driver and plan to speak to our local office shortly.

Thanks for considering this.

I called <DATE_TIME> and spoke with <PERSON> about concerns I had with a recent order (#111423385RS).

I purchased this item...

But was sent this item...
<URL>
It is unclear if these are the same glasses but packaged or branded differently. The specifications do not fully match from each site. the discrepancies include the height and oz. capacity as well as the makers material.

Also, one of the glasses has a small chip in the outer edge. It appears to be a manufacturing flaw and is rough to the touch, making it unusable. Please see images provided below of the chip, packaging box showing the items are LSA brand and a copy of the packaging slip for reference.

<PERSON> and I discussed the possibility of replacing the one chipped glass or returning the entire set. After consideration, given the discrepancies, I have decided I'd prefer to return the set for a refund. Please let me know what steps to take next. Thank you.

I’m writing this with a lump in my throat because I’ve never written anything like this email before.

My name is <PERSON> and my sons name is <PERSON>, we’re both rc addicts and love the lowrider lines yall have. I have a Blue 64 and <PERSON> has a green and gold Monte, he tells everyone it’s green for the money and gold for the honeys!! He actually won a best of class award at the local Walmart Show for his Monte and is absolutely hooked on shows now.

I recently went through a very very bad divorce at <DATE_TIME>, lost the ability to live in my home until I can get full custody. Lost our shop that we built rc’s and real Lowriders in… and having a <DATE_TIME> Autistic kiddo that doesn’t understand why mommy doesn’t want him has taken a toll.

His birthday is in <DATE_TIME> and he has only asked for a COE since before <DATE_TIME>, I frankly cannot afford to feed our need for a new rc for awhile so I figured I’d reach out and see if yall had any programs or $1 a month finance programs I can take advantage of!!

I don’t know how else to word a plea for help for my kiddo, and I fully understand if it’s a “sorry dude” but I had to ask!! Thank you so much for providing such a badass product so my one and only kiddo have such a strong bond with! It means more to us dads than yall might know, and having him be able to focus on his car and keep his attention more than anything else is amazing.

I have been sending emails and left a voicemail during the 60% off black <DATE_TIME> special and haven't heard back from you.
I had several items in my bag and went to order them and it wouldn't let the order go through.
Your customer service has never replied.

I really wanted to replenish my supply of snow whitening get mainly but now they are twice the price or more.

Just wanted to let you know that your customer service isn't well at all so I guess I missed out on the special,

I will look elsewhere for my teeth whitening from now on I guess.
Just thought you should know.

If you go back in your emails you will see where I have left several emails to no avail.

<PERSON>Customer's Message: please reply. I get texts about 60% off then it now shows full price.
Customer's Message: Hello.
I tried to order <DATE_TIME> or <DATE_TIME> but didn't want to get a reorder of the strips since I am buying (or was buying) a <DATE_TIME> supply of the teeth whitening gel
so didn't feel I'd use them. I left a message which I am assuming  you are closed so haven't gotten it yet.
I tried again <DATE_TIME>, as I had an email to complete my order and it did go through without the auto ship on the strips so I processed my order, used a coupon code and my purchase was $72.70 with free shipping. Then I was told the shipping had changed so now I see that they are wanting to charge me $20 for shipping as well.

I did want the order but think $20 shipping is a bit excessive. Anyway, if you can approve the order for the $72.70 total, that would be great and I would like to place the order.
If not I guess I'll wait or go back to crest white strips.

Thanks for your help.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes and happy holidays.

Agent's Message: Hello <PERSON>,
Thank you for reaching out. I understand the beeping noise is causing you discomfort. Let's try changing to a larger earbud size first, as this can often resolve feedback issues. If the problem persists, we'll explore other options. Additionally, have you tried to change the position of the hearing or rotating it. The feedback is caused when the microphone on the hearing aid presses again your ear canal. This can be alleviated by just changing the position of the device so that it does not come in contact with your ear canal.  Please let me know how it goes.
Best regards,

Totally get where you're coming from!
Our discount codes are like lone wolves – they prefer solo missions and don't team up with other offers or codes. So, when you used the WELCOME15 code, it overrode the promo deal. Each one's a star in its own right :-)

I just placed an order last night - #<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>

Originally I saw that the mat & the ice trays were included for free, but when I saw them in the cart, they weren't. Because of that, I just removed them from my cart before checking out.

In saying that, my friend just went to buy a Pod and he said that those items zero'd out once he got to the actual checkout. I guess I was just going to quick haha

Is there any way you guys could still send me the mat & ice trays?

Here’s a <IN_PAN> of a warranty, can clearly see ‘refund’ highlighted.
Agent's Message: Hi Lilly,
Please <IN_PAN> I am just following our policy.
I am sorry you are not satisfied with our product.
I could refund 40% the cost of the bracelet as a one time courtesy. Please note this is the max I would be able to refund since <DATE_TIME> window has expired.
Customer's Message: I’m sorry but this is not good customer service. For the price of your products, the quality should not be this bad! my partner has many bracelets of the same material and not one has tarnished after a couple of times of use. Your prices are <IN_PAN> and I was made to think because of the price of your products I’d get good quality from it. Only now after reading your reviews I see this is an ongoing problem so surely you realise how poor quality the products are… not one review over 2 stars! I’d like a refund as I’m not happy with your product for the time it’s been used. It isn’t right for it to be this tarnished after a couple of uses, and store credit is pointless as I’m never wanting to order from a website like this again. Biggest waste of money!
Many thanks.
Agent's Message: Hi Lilly,
I apologize, but since <DATE_TIME> have passed, we can only offer you a free replacement or a store credit.
Please note note gold Vermeil pieces are gold plated over sterling silver.
Although gold vermeil pieces are durable and can be polished with a soft polishing cloth, they can tarnish because of exposure to the environment and natural oils of the skin. If you have acidic skin this can cause them to tarnish faster. Things such as lotions, perfumes or even soap and water can cause vermeil to tarnish as well.
I recommend lightly polishing your Gold Vermeil pieces after wear to avoid <IN_PAN>. You can simply use a soft <IN_PAN> polishing cloth to gently polish your gold vermeil pieces.
Thanks,
Customer's Message: Hello,

Thank you for the offer but Im respectfully declining it and would like a refund please, as the product isn’t of merchantable quality and I would not want to buy something else from the website and run into the same problem.

Customer's Message: Well Jose, if you <IN_PAN> then why not resolve the problem.  I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who has this issue with <LOCATION>.  I'm only so bold as to give feedback that <LOCATION> <IN_PAN> wants to hear from customers.

In the beginning soon as I got the hearing aids thru Amazon, <LOCATION> people bombarded me with emails/phone calls claiming they are here for me, if I ever have questions, or issues, then contact them.

Well, I've done both.  At first the contact was annoying as I hadn't had a chance to do more than get them out of the box and read <IN_PAN>, watch videos online as to how to use them and what to expect.

Then came the emails, they couldn't find my order.  I kept telling them and providing the Amazon order number but still a different person would write saying they couldn't find my order.  Frustrating.

Then I finally ran into an issue that <PERSON> wrote about saying to change the wax plug.  HIs advice worked, and soon I learned the replacement wax plugs only came in a $12 box with <IN_PAN> in it called the toolkit.  2/3 of which I don't need to replace.

Now I have an issue with one of the plugs that cleaning, replacing the wax plug, changing out the ear dome, nothing has worked, even turning the volume fully up and fully down, only gets me the rushing wind noise, not the sound from the TV.

Finally someone wrote the other day and said it does seem I have a defective plug, and he wanted me to respond verifying the information.  Don't know what that information was as it's not in his email but I responded to hold off <DATE_TIME> and I'll check it again.  I did that, it does not work so I replied that it didn't work and guess I need a replacement.  I hope they tell me how / if to return the defective one.  At first I just wanted to have them tell me how I could fix it without returning, what did I need to do that I wasn't aware of to do in order to get it to work.  It did for <DATE_TIME> when I first got it.

Trying still to get used to them, but at this point I'm not honestly a big fan of <LOCATION>, or hearing aids.  Ready to throw them in the trash, learn my lesson, turn the TV back up to 40, and my wife can get some ear plugs or ear muffs and enjoy the show.

<PERSON> Message: Hello <PERSON>,

I <IN_PAN> the frustration with not being able to order specific parts and the lack of support you've received. We value your feedback and are here to help.

Customer's Message: ok Fenwick, it just doesn't work as it used to or as the other one does.  Thanks for waiting till I could double check it <DATE_TIME>.  I hope there will be instructions with the replacement for me to return this faulty one so you can check it out.  Got an optometrist appointment in <DATE_TIME> so will have to head out for that.  Thanks!

<PERSON> Message: <PERSON>!

Glad to finally hear from someone at <LOCATION> about this, but before we go any further, I'm not convinced the aid is really defective.

I decided to try checking it out again since I had put that one in the toolkit and had been using just the other one.  <DATE_TIME> upon reading your email I took the ear dome off of the bad one and tried it alone without any dome on it.  Does one need those domes anyhow?  What is the purpose of them?  They all seem to be the same to me and using the aid without any dome it seemed to work.

I put on <PERSON> and their rendition of <PERSON> did you know (love that song) and alternating with the aid in or out I thought it seemed the aid was working, without the dome remember.

Tried it with both aids, alternating with having them in and out, and alternating ears with each plug.  Seems it might be working, at least without the dome.  Could that have been blocking the sound?

I'll keep this email of course and test it more <DATE_TIME> while watchiing TV.  That's really all i need it for, or lets say I don't need aids, my wife just thinks I do so the TV can be turned down.  It's not excessive loud to begin with.

With the aids in she has been asking me to turn the TV up for her.  I control the remote!  <DATE_TIME> she asked me if I could hear the TV ok.  I said yes, can't you?  (I had it on mute, can't stand the commercials).  I did come clean though and admitted it was muted.

I'll be in touch and thanks for <IN_PAN>.  I really just wanted to know how to fix the issue, thought you guys might know more as to what was happening.  I might have found the solution <DATE_TIME> on my own investigation.

<PERSON> Message: .Hello <PERSON>,
Thank you for providing your details. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with one of your hearing aids. Since you've already tried cleaning and replacing the wax guard without success, it seems like there might be a defect with that unit. As it's under a lifetime warranty, we can proceed with a replacement for the faulty aid. Please reply to this email to confirm, and we'll take care of the rest.
Best regards,

Customer's Message: You know when I first got my Atom hearing aids, I was flooded with <LOCATION> emails, phone calls offering help.  I wrote the other day saying I needed help fixing one of the aids and to <DATE_TIME> I have not heard one peep from <LOCATION>.

I've had two emails saying they can't find my order when I provided the information in the very beginning to you.  I purchased them thru Amazon because they were the same price, the same aids, and could be delivered to me <DATE_TIME> as compared to your website that said it would be <DATE_TIME> before shipping to me.

I am ready to throw these in the trash.  I have replaced the origianal wax plugs, had to order a kit with a new supply in them along with the ear domes and another tool kit.  Only thing I got that I didn't have already was the plastic box.  I <IN_PAN> I have to reorder a kit to get more wax plugs in the future.  Along with that will come more ear domes which are not needed.  Point is I'm paying for things I don't need.

I should be able to order a quantity of wax plugs alone.  The ear domes need to be <IN_PAN> as to which pkg is small, medium or large.  They all look the same to me.  I only need the one size I settle on when I need to reorder them.  Probably won't because the hearing aids are either going to be returned to Amazon, or thrown in the trash can.  I'll just turn the TV volume back up to 40 and my wife can get some ear plugs or muffs.

<PERSON><PERSON>
Customer's Message: Well don't know how many times I've already done this but here it is again.  I ordered thru Amazon because I could get them <DATE_TIME> (my B-day) instead of waiting <DATE_TIME> thru your website.  Same for the toolkit I received.

Email is this one <EMAIL_ADDRESS>; order # is ORDER # 113-<CREDIT_CARD> an Amazon order number/; First name is <PERSON>, Last is <PERSON>;   phone number is <UK_NHS> my cell  or the landline <DATE_TIME> but that is set to forward to my cell so I get all the scammer calls.  This also has been verified to have lifetime warranty and I could probably find that email <IN_PAN> such if you can't.

Just tell me how to fix this one unit.  It still just gives the rushing wind noise and cleaning the front, replacing the wax plugs has not helped restore it.

Thanks whomever you are.  I've been contacted and responded to <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and a host of other employees at <LOCATION>.  I'm not a big fan yet of these, they are kind of a pain in the butt but before you tell me I'm inserting them in the wrong place, I'll let you know I have that correct.

<PERSON> Message: Hi ,
I wasn't able to locate your order with your email, <EMAIL_ADDRESS>. Could you please confirm your first and last name, email address, phone number, and the order number <IN_PAN> with your order?
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Customer's Message: Ok, so I've been trying to get used to these.  One now seems to only have the rushing wind noise, no sound coming from the TV as it did in the beginning.  Other aid is ok.  Both are fully charged.  I've changed the wax plug and using an alcohol wipe (prep kind of size) I still cannot get the one to hear anything but the rushing wind sound.  Tried brushing the tip as you say to do .  Any suggestions?  I've turned volume up and down on both but this one has stopped working it seems to me.

I'm about out of the wax plugs, which once used whether or not it fixes the problem, I've lost a plug.  Don't care for buying a whole kit just to get some more wax plugs.

Ear domes to me all look the same.  Your bags don't identify which one is small, med, or large.  I've tried all three and don't see or find <PERSON> <IN_PAN> in any  of them.  Also it seems if I found the correct size for me that I should be able to order just that size.  Why do I need the other two?  I just end up with a lot of domes with no other useful purpose.

Sorry to complain a little by you've asked for my comments and I'm not going to sugar coat what I <IN_PAN>.

Thanks for <IN_PAN>, hopefully you have a good solution to the current issue.

<PERSON> from <PERSON>Customer's Message: <PERSON> there isn't anything in my cart. I set the qty to zero and ordered the kit thru Amazon. Got it <DATE_TIME> .

<PERSON> from AOL on Android
Customer's Message: I ordered thru Amazon because they could deliver it in <DATE_TIME>. So I should have it <DATE_TIME> and it should be here soon since i't now <DATE_TIME>.  Your site said <DATE_TIME> at the same price considering shipping so since i""m out of wax plugs, have used all in the initial box I can't use my aids till I get these.  <IN_PAN> I'll need to have a supply on hand and I'm not really happy to be required to purchase a kit with items not necessary to have each time I need wax plugs.  Not sure how this is going to work.  I don't have an ear wax problem, never have had.  I wish I could buy a quantity of the wax plugs/tools alone.  Extra ear domes aren't needed and neither are the different sizes that won't be used.  Good to have the 3 sizes in the initial hearing aid box but when one size is selected as the best one to use, the other two are unnecessary.

<PERSON><PERSON>
Customer's Message: Thanks <PERSON> for that information.  I have ordered the toolkit thru Amazon because I can get it <DATE_TIME>, I'm out of the wax guards, lost one of those damn little plugs and neither my wife or I can find it.  Not <IN_PAN> for me as I have only the right eye.  She will spot a pill that is on the floor I didn't realize.

Now I can't really say these hearing aids are going to be worth it for me.  Already used the wax plugs, and not keen on buying a complete toolkit each time I need more.  Not sure why I would need <IN_PAN> screwdrivers or ear domes.

Now on your site I notice one can set up a ""subscription"" to receive a toolkit <DATE_TIME> for $9.00.  So if <PERSON> offers that it's an admission the wax guards or ear domes are replaceable on a regular basis.  So far since I've gone thru all of my initial quantity and realizing the wax guards will probably be replenished on a regular basis the hearing aids now become expensive.

So just another consideration as I go thru my trial period.  You asked for my thoughts and I gave them.

Now my question is how do I get <IN_PAN> wax plugs/tools?  My ears are clean, and I don't have, never have had an excessive wax issue.  <URL>ese aids seem to be quite sensitive to whatever causes the wax plug to need replacement.

I saw the ""kit"" with some wax plug tools and other stuff but can't I just get the wax tools separate?  The case would be nice, but don't need all the other stuff that comes with the kit.  At least I don't think/hope that I do.

Customer's Message: Good Morning Sam,

Don't <IN_PAN> the <IN_PAN> to give the $25 Holiday Sale money to Amazon buyers.  There is nothing on your website that indicates it's for the web only unless that is revealed once the phone number is given.  I didn't go that far to see which I've explained to <PERSON> in my first email.

Maybe you charge shipping via your website, can't see that either and I have Amazon Prime which is free shipping 99% of the time.  Amazon does a terrific job with the system Bezos created.  I just don't agree with his politics.  <IN_PAN> drivers are very courteous, pleasant and professional.

I changed the wax guard as you suggested, and it appears that corrected the issue.  Will get back to the ""getting use to"" part of <DATE_TIME>.  Used the one that worked when our family was here for <DATE_TIME> as well as listening to TV.  Used to set the volume to a ""40"" and my wife would complain, but with the one hearing aid in I can hear with it set to 25.

I assume the tool and wax guard I removed is to be discarded at this point?

If these work, they are a good purchase. Beats the ENT, hearing <IN_PAN>, hearing test which always indicates the  need <PERSON> hearing aids.  My ENT asked <DATE_TIME> after I just had a hearing test, how it went.  I told him the girl said I was a good candidate for hearing aids.  He got quite a belly laugh over that and said everyone is a good candidate.  Doesn't mean you need them yet.  This was probably <DATE_TIME>.

So thanks for help and advice.  I'll be in touch if something else becomes a problem with these but I think I'm in business.

Thanks <PERSON>!

I received my <PERSON> <DATE_TIME> (my birthday) and one of them, after insuring it's fully charged and turned on does not have any sound.  Not even whistling, noise when turned on full volume.  I also would like the $25 off I see promoted on your website as we weren't offered that thru Amazon.
   Would like to see if these help, get thru <DATE_TIME> of preparation but can't really do so until I get two good aids.  This one unit seems totally dead.

Thank you very much for your patience. I tried to contact SDA again and request a new shipment. They told me that it is not possible at the moment because they have to carry out checks following the complaint. The operator sent a new reminder, currently I'm waiting for news from them.
Thank you and I wish you a good day.

I'm <PERSON> and I placed an order on your website number #JHLA24814. I had some problems with the shipment: a delivery attempt was made and then the courier decided to send the package back. The tracking number is 3A5V707515049.
<DATE_TIME> I contacted SDA (the shipping company that was in charge of the package) who told me to contact you because the package is no longer in their charge as it is returning and to schedule a new shipment. It's possible? I really need these shoes.
I have already made a complaint about the inefficiency to SDA, it would be useful for you to do so too.
Thank you for your attention, I await a reply.
I wish you a good day.
Sincerely,

Thank you for reaching out. That is good news.

Also, as mentioned in a previous email I did not receive carry case for my poles (I was told it was carrying the chair but it wasn’t.)

I will talk with my post office to get the label sorted and a tracking number as well.
When you receive my item, how long should I expect for the refund to be issued?

Customer's Message: Hi.
Yes it has “obviously been used”
Typically consumers try products before they make a decision on whether or not it is for them.
Your company should not be promoting <DATE_TIME> money back guaranteed if you’re going to fine print that it needs to be unused, that is NOT honoring a <DATE_TIME> money back guaranteed. So you want me to keep my sauna that I am unhappy with and it does not suit my needs and has burned my toe from the steam? That does’t exactly fit into the warranty & guarantees tab you have under all the specs of the product.

I’ve also noticed this company deletes any reviews under 5 stars off their company website and won’t show anything under. And your Facebook doesn’t allow people to review. You’re conducting shady, unprofessional business. I’ve also noticed people sharing to their own Facebook how you guys refuse returns.
Agent's Message: Hello <LOCATION>,
Allow me to clarify some points.
We do not need a photo of your foot. We need anything proving that you were burned because of our product. Those are 2 different things.
It was very clear in my previous message that you also have the option to just send a video detailing the issue of the sauna, because it is what we are interested in. We are not interested in any part of your body.
Since you are already on our website, you may want to check on this too -
<URL>
This is exactly why I was asking you for a photo or a video proof - so I can help you further.
Your sauna has obviously been used and if you don't have anything to show us that there is something wrong with it then it is not qualified to be returned.
The steam pools in the base of my sauna and leaks and makes my floor soaking wet. -
please send us a video showing this exact issue so we can move forward.
Customer's Message: “Easy returns”
Customer's Message: Hi there,
You can NOT be serious that you are really asking for a photo of my foot? That’s some customer service!! I am actually mind blown right now.
I can send a video of my sauna <DATE_TIME> but I will NOT be sending you a photo of my foot.

Please get me in contact with someone higher up in position.
I will be returning my sauna and I want my money back from dissatisfaction with the product.

As stated on your website,

“<DATE_TIME> money back guarantee”
“If you are unhappy with your order, we’ll help you with the return and refund you.”
Agent's Message: Hello <LOCATION>,
Would you be able to send us any photo to document the issue? A photo of the burn on your foot, etc? Or any video showing the issue so we can have this escalated.
Customer's Message: Please let me know how I start the process to return. Thanks.
Customer's Message: I’m sad to say the least, I wanted to absolutely love it. But now I rarely use it since I got it.

The steam pools in the base of my sauna and leaks and makes my floor soaking wet.
I have now been burnt twice now from the steam on my foot & toe.

Customer's Message: Once again no response.
No response on social channels either.

This is so sketchy.
I am informing my credit card that this is a scam.

To bad because I was so excited, and happy to support a <NRP> endeavour.
Customer's Message: But I paid for <DATE_TIME>, with the next charge being in <DATE_TIME>. So that makes no sense. I will then have two orders arrive at once, or shortly after one another! I wanted one now, <DATE_TIME>. As would make logical sense....
Also the ad that this email stemmed from said ""Want to skip pre-order? Here you go."" I ordered <DATE_TIME> prior to that ad. Why can't I get one of the skip copies?? I should be shipped before any of those people. Which is what I thought I was buying. I didn't buy the bundle, which said it was a pre-order, I ordered ONE journal <DATE_TIME>, which did not indicate it was a pre-order. I wanted it for <DATE_TIME> start.
Agent's Message: Hi,
This product is currently available for pre-order only. You will receive your shipment in <DATE_TIME>. Delivery dates can vary, and we will let you know if estimates change. International delivery estimates may be longer.
With our printable <IN_PAN> (free with every purchase), you can get started right away. If you are gifting, and your purchase will not arrive in time for <DATE_TIME>, your purchase includes a printable <PERSON> gift card to share with the lucky giftee!

Seriously. If I don't hear by <DATE_TIME> I am calling and reporting a scam to my credit card company.

I have not received a response, so I am following up.

If I don't hear by <DATE_TIME> I suppose I will cancel and/or ask my credit card to cancel? I just want to make sure this isn't a scam. So much is a scam lately.

Thank you for your quick response and your help.  I have my patterns and am looking forward to making my new purses.

Thanks again,

<PERSON>
Agent's Message: Hi <PERSON> ,
Sure, I can help. I have updated your link.
You can download the PDF copy from this link I have grabbed for from your order. It will also take you back to the download screen:
<URL>
Just a reminder to save the file to your computer and then open it in Adobe Reader, do not try to print from a browser screen or the pattern pieces will not be the right size.
Here is where you download Adobe:
<URL>
Here is a tutorial I made to help you print the pattern pages the right size:
<LOCATION>
If your pattern pages print black
: The reason this is happening is because Adobe Reader did an update to their software which prints transparencies black. This is particularly an issue on our pattern pages because they have transparent areas. To fix this, you need to
update your Adobe Reader
. If you need to update, you can do that under the ""help"" tab by clicking ""check for updates.""
If you are working on a device that is older and will not allow you to update, a fix for this is to print the PDF in black and white, or print just those pages in <LOCATION> and white. If you don't have Adobe reader, a free download, you should download this and print using it because it will be the way to print ""actual size"".
I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any more questions.

I will personally reship that to you as soon as it arrives, which looks like it will be <DATE_TIME> or <DATE_TIME>. I am also going to refund your shipping charges due to us not changing the shipping address for you.
If you would like to try to shipping to your work again in the future, I do wonder if you change it to NE and AVE in your shipping field will work for you. I think next time, you can definitely input that instead and we will give it a try. It's unfortunate that they don't have actual people looking at these addresses.

Thank you for reaching out and for choosing our sauna! 🌿 We're glad to hear that you've been enjoying it.

I'm sorry to hear about the issue you're experiencing with the heat and steam. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. Ensure that the water reservoir is filled to the recommended level for optimal steam <IN_PAN>.

2. Sometimes, residue buildup can affect the sauna's performance. Cleaning the heating elements with a gentle solution might help.

3. Double-check that the sauna is properly plugged in and that there are no loose connections.

If these tips don't resolve the issue, please don't hesitate to reach out to us again. We <IN_PAN> your patience and support!

I <IN_PAN> your response and the explanation.  The outcome with a few layers of cotton fabric is slightly better, but still not a full cut.  That said, as you mentioned I can use the manual hole punch for the holes, or use it for the partial hole and carefully trim the uncut portion.  I also have the benefit of the press for the rivets which is wonderful, and what I really wanted.  No disappointment at all, I am always so impressed and happy with all of your products and service.  Have a wonderful day,

Re: <PERSON>,

I understand how frustrating it can be when a product doesn't work as expected. We do want to make sure that all of our products are in perfect condition and functioning well. <PERSON> leather is thin and stretchy and because of this, this particular cutter will not handle this material well in thin layers.

Can you please try to cut a few layers of vinyl, leather or several layers of fabric and see how it works. One thing that may help would be if you put a stiff interfacing in front and in behind of the faux leather, or put a layer of stiff leather in front.

The cutter doesn't work for all fibres, and that is why it is a free item that we put in complimentary with the press. It doesn't work for every situation, so this is why we link to a preferred punch in the listing as well. I am afraid an exchange will not benefit your results for this free item. It does work well with different materials, and I hope you can use it for different applications.

I hope that explanation helps in some way, and I am sorry for any disappointment this causes, <PERSON>.

Sincerely,

Customer's Message: Good <DATE_TIME>,

I hope your day is off to a great start, happy <DATE_TIME>!

I'm writing regarding a recent Kam rivet press machine online order.  Unfortunately, there is a problem with the hole cutter die set which is not working properly.  I think it's the bottom piece that has a defect.  I've attached a couple of pictures that show the issue, but it does not create a full hole, even when I use only one layer of mora vinyl.  When I turn/twist the bottom die slightly, the ""uncut"" section aligns with the turn, if that makes sense.  In other words, it seems the bottom piece isn't designed to apply pressure evenly.

I also attached a picture of the pieces I'm using, just so you know I'm not mixing up the double cap rivets die set with the hole cutter die set.

The double cap rivets die set works just fine.  🙂

I'm wondering if I can exchange the hole cutter die set pieces?  The press itself is great, as well as the double cap rivets die set.

Thanks so much,

<PERSON>

I’ve just received and opened the replacement.
Again there is no scent to this.
I absolutely loved the free sample I was sent, it lasted <DATE_TIME> and was absolutely beautiful.
This smells like I’ve been sent a bottle of mouthwash.
I’m assuming it’s not been checked and I’d say there is a batch error.
There is no perfume in either of these bottles.
It’s pretty much a bottle of scentless alcohol.

Can somebody check these and cutter me one sent out that smells as it should.

I understand your concern, but I want to assure you that the samples we provide contain the same concentration as our larger perfume bottles. If you're experiencing any issues with the sample you received, I'd be happy to send you a new bottle and provide a return label for the defective one. We'll investigate what might have gone wrong. However, please note that while our perfumes always have a 25% oil concentration, I cannot guarantee that the next bottle will meet your specific expectations.

I bought this after seeing the sample I’d received I little while back.
I’m actually really disappointed with this one as the scent does not seem quite the same and definitely isn’t lasting as the sample did.
Could this be a batch error? I’m really hoping so.

Hopefully you can help and suggest a solution or reason.

How do I return my order for a refund? The Hermes copy is super weak but it does smell
Like <PERSON>. The Aqua di Parma one is really not to my taste. I did run a GCMS analysis on it for <PERSON> and the composition is quite close but there are quite a few missing elements.

Dbl choc strawberry cereal
This is the Chocolate Puffs cereal with white chocolate pieces and freeze dried strawberry bits added. Or rather it would be, if the bag I received had any white chocolate or strawberry pieces in it at all. This batch must have missed the white choc and strawberry conveyor belts because it's literally just nothing but the Chocolate Puffs. Still good, nothing wrong with the product, but disappointing that it's incomplete.

<PERSON> Message: Thank you for your request, and we appreciate your desire for a customized piece. However, we want to inform you that the standard piece comes with the Miansai logo already applied, and it is not possible to remove it directly.
If you still wish to proceed with your request, we would be happy to create a custom order for you. This would involve crafting the piece from scratch without the Miansai logo. Please note that this process might take a bit longer and will have an extra charge.
If you agree to this option, please let us know, and we will proceed with creating the custom order for you. If you have any further questions or requests, feel free to inform us.
We appreciate your understanding and look forward to fulfilling your expectations.

Agent's Message: We can prepare a parcel for you <DATE_TIME>, and even though our workshop is closed during <DATE_TIME>, which you can pick up at our store in Ramsgate at any time. This is the fastest option available. Unfortunately, it's not possible to send a parcel that reaches you by <DATE_TIME> due to <DATE_TIME> delivery restrictions. If these solutions don't work for you, I can arrange a refund. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Agent's Message: The situation is very suspicious, I think someone intercepted your order.  It's probably too late to look for the person responsible for collecting your parcel.  We can send your order to your home, and you can always redirect it to collection at your post office.  All you need to do is use your shipment tracking number after you receive a card informing you that your delivery attempt was unsuccessful.

Agent's Message: Hi <PERSON>,
I'm sorry to hear the Atom Pro did not meet your needs and I want to thank you for your patience so far. Please give me the opportunity to make things right for you.
We did just release our
Atom Pro 2
, which will specifically address the issues you had with the Atom Pro. I think if we upgrade you to the Atom Pro 2 it will be perfect for you.
Here are a few exciting new features of the Atom Pro 2:
28% smaller
Better <IN_PAN> noise cancellation / feedback reduction
New <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> chip for better sound quality & speech clarity
4 unique hearing modes so you can pick what works best for your hearing loss
Portable charging case w/ UV cleaning <IN_PAN>
It typically retails for $289, however what I can do is upgrade you from your Atom to the Atom Pro 2 for only $50.
I can also give you free shipping on your upgrade, and it will include a <DATE_TIME> money back guarantee, just in case the Atom Pro 2 doesn't work for you.
Let me know if you'd like to try the upgrade and I could get it shipped out to you right away!

Customer's Message: I have done that already. When I do, the hearing aid that lit up green on one side lights
up green on the other side. The charger appears to be functioning normally.

Hi <PERSON> ,

Thank you for reaching out.

Could you please try placing the defective hearing aid on a
different socket of the charger? This will help us determine
if the issue lies with the charger's socket or the hearing
aid itself.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Thank you,

Customer's Message: <DATE_TIME> I left it in the charger for another cycle, but it did not fully charge.
Here is what happens:

After a number of <DATE_TIME> of charging, one is charged and other
one flashes red. Then it flashes green from time to time, but it mostly flashes red. It never turns green the way the other one does. Then when I turn it on and put it in it works for a little while, then it makes a <IN_PAN> sound and then shuts off. It
is clearly not working the way it did initially and does not work the way the other one does.

Learn why this is important
Could you please confirm if both of them are turned off
while charging like the photo below? It's worth <IN_PAN>
that the blue light means that there is a power running
through them. It's worth <IN_PAN> that a red light means
that
the hearing aid is still charging so you may leave it on
charging for an extra one cycle of <DATE_TIME>.
Thank you,

Audien Support
Customer's Message: Yes, they are both shut off. On the rare occasions that I forget to turn one of them off, it feeds back and I can hear it so I do turn it off. The thing is, one of them is clearly charged and the other one just never stops flashing and that has never been the
case.

Thanks for getting back to me.

Customer's Message: Hi <PERSON>,
Another hearing has begun to malfunction. This one started by not charging properly. One hearing aid would charge and the other one would continue to flash red. However, when I put them in they both seemed to work so I didn't think anything of it. <DATE_TIME>, it started to make a crunching noise and then it shut off. I have had to take it out. As much as I have enjoyed using these hearing aids I must say that I am disappointed. I have been very careful with them. I keep them in their holder, I keep them clean and dry and never <IN_PAN> them. Despite that, two of them have broken. You replaced the first one <DATE_TIME> but I spent a lot of money shipping it back to you. Also, you said you would send the replacement when I sent the tracking number to you but it did not ship for <DATE_TIME> after I sent the tracking number.
I don't know if there is anything you can do for me but I think I am going to try an alternative.

Yes, by tracking number we mean the number provided by your
shipping carrier (UPS, FedEx, etc.) when you out the
package. It's important to have this number as it allows us
to track the return shipment. You can package the item in a
small
box or padded envelope.

Unfortunately, we do not provide prepaid shipping labels for
returns. Please ensure that you keep a receipt or proof of
shipment until the return process is complete.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Customer's Message: Hi <PERSON>,
I am enjoying your product but unfortunately I have a problem. One of the hearing aids is malfunctioning. I am getting a crackle sound similar to a blown speaker. Then it shuts off. I think it was caused by a loud alarm that went off near where I was standing. The other one seems to be working fine. Is there a way to get one replaced? I made the original purchase at <DATE_TIME>.

Customer's Message: Hi Audien Team,
I am interested in participating in this program and believe I would be a good reviewer for your products.  I am happy with my hearing aids thus far and I have actually owned very expensive custom-fit hearing aids. I think yours are better.   However, I would like to get the Atom Pro rather than the Atom. In addition, I am happy to not take the $50 if you will allow me to upgrade for free.  One issue I have with the Atom is the feedback and I understand that the better hearing aid has less feedback. Also, the <PERSON> seems smaller than the ones I have. Let me know what you think.

If you do not hear back from us within <DATE_TIME>, please kindly email us for an update.
Customer's Message: Good <DATE_TIME>,

I understand the shipping issues. However, this could have been avoided if your customer service would have responded to my numerous emails. I contacted you before <DATE_TIME> which gave you time to resolve the situation. Also, I tried to reach out to you via other methods to bring this to your attention.

At this point, I don't feel comfortable purchasing something else with the current shipping issues. Therefore, the discount code does not provide me any benefit.

I really enjoyed the planner, but I need something that is going to arrive on time. Also, I am hesitant about the change to the non-dated model, but I will give it a try.

Please feel free to reach out to me once you resolve the shipping issues and improve the customer service process. Assuming the new format works for me, I would then consider returning as a subscriber.

In the meantime, I would be happy to talk with anyone about my experience if it would help improve things.

Have a blessed day!

Thank you for reaching out, and I <IN_PAN> your patience. We recently sent out a shipping update regarding international orders. To keep you up to date, I included it at the bottom of this message. You can reply to me when you decide which solution you would like.
In the meantime, your tracking link has been updated! Which means it's not advisable to issue a replacement. You can track your order here:
<DATE_TIME>
The shipping update is below this line

Dear #PashFam,
Thank you for your support and patience <DATE_TIME>! We received word from our fulfillment center that international orders were picked up by FedEx before <DATE_TIME> and that tracking for these orders would update soon. However, it has recently come to our attention that tracking has not started to update for some of these orders.
If you’re receiving this email, it is likely your order has been impacted by delays. We know this isn’t the best news and we truly apologize for this experience. You may have already received a message from our CEO regarding issues with our fulfillment partner. We’ve been following up multiple times a day with our fulfillment partner, but unfortunately they’ve still been slow to respond to us. We don’t think it’s right for you to have to wait for an answer from them either. Please find 3 solution options below and simply reply back to this email with the number of the solution you would like, and we will get back to you as soon as we can! If you’ve already emailed our support team, you can reply to your original email and we will take care of you.
Solution 1: Wait for your order with no refund: If you’re okay with waiting and do not want a refund, no need to do anything. We are now expecting tracking for orders to start updating <DATE_TIME> so be on the lookout for updated tracking! If you change your mind and want another solution, please let us know and it will be taken care of.
Solution 2: Keep your order and receive a 50% refund: If you’ve waited over <DATE_TIME> for your order, please feel free to ask for a 50% refund.
Solution 3: Keep your order and receive a full refund. If you’ve waited over <DATE_TIME> for your order, please feel free to ask for a full refund. If your order happens to still arrive after you get a refund, consider it a gift from us for your patience.
Please note that we are currently working through more than a thousand tickets so your patience is greatly appreciated. We promise your refund will be handled as soon as possible.

We will issue you a full refund of your order.

First, can you tell me the status of #<PHONE_NUMBER> and 16349.

Second, I need to know which one of my orders will arrive before <DATE_TIME>.

Third, if nothing is going to arrive before <DATE_TIME>, then I need help cancelling my orders. I’ve been trying to get clarity on these issues for <DATE_TIME> and I am extraordinarily disappointed with the very slow response. I am very concerned that after spending $120 <DATE_TIME> that I’m not going to receive anything, if I don’t get clarity I will call my bank’s fraud line and ask them to reclaim my money due to the absence of transparency.

I would like a planner ASAP. What needs to happen to accomplish this?

Better than magic spoon
I love this cereal, it’s much better than magic spoon, cheaper and local! I like that it doesn’t stick to my teeth like magic spoons does. The flavour is better too! There’s only 3 flavours so far but they are good and enjoyable to eat unlike magic spoon which tastes very milk wheyish and requires a full cleaning session with a toothpick after 🤦‍♂️

Hello Adriane, it is okay I don't sending them.

The order notes are in the cart, so if you get to the checkout , it is too late to find a spot to add the note, and I don't think they sow in the checkout. So you have to go back to the cart, which is before checkout.

I hope that helps!

Customer's Message: Hi <PERSON>,

Thanks for getting back to me. I am wondering if maybe I cannot see the notes portion in the checkout on my phone. If I have anything that I need to add in the notes for the future maybe I will try placing the order on my computer. I see that you have placed the order for samples with the  snaps. I don't expect you to send the snaps at no cost. I can <IN_PAN> pay for them.

Re: Message from Emmaline Bags Inc.

Hello <PERSON>,

I am sorry for your disappointment. I was told by our staff that you needed a sample and missed adding that for you. We were thinking that the weight for it may have just ticked it above the letter mark and into parcel. In the future you can <IN_PAN> order 2x and have both as letters and it will keep it much cheaper than having it go to parcel. I did intend on putting the sample in and seeing if it would stay under weight, and if not I was going to put it in a separate letter for you.

You can add a note to your order by clicking on ""Add Order Note'' while viewing your cart. This option is not available once you are on the checkout page.  See the attached image for more information on doing that.

I would be happy to send you the sample in a letter now, and if you like I an send you the snaps. I don't think we have any issues with the cart or site, but if you see anything in your cart that is a 1 and you need it to be a 2, you can edit the cart to add more.

I will get that out to you right away. The shipping should just be 1.90, but of course we will send it for free.

I hope that helps. I am sorry that I missed putting in the sample.

Customer's Message: Hi there,

I tried calling a few times and got sent to voicemail. I received my order <DATE_TIME> and am a bit disappointed. I ordered your lightweight interfacing as I knew for sure I needed light. I have never ordered <PERSON> interfacing before so I wanted the sample pack as well. I need medium or heavy but wasn't sure which one suited my needs. When I tried to add the sample pack to my order it took my shipping from $4.44 to like $16. I called an spoke to someone and they said to add a note to add the sample. When I put in my order it did not have a spot for a note so I put in my order in and called your staff member back and they said they would let shipping know to add the sample. I received my package <DATE_TIME> and there is no sample. This sucks as I do need interfacing either medium or heavy and dont know which one to order from you. Also not a huge deal but I had 2 antique brass snaps in my cart when I reviewed my order and once I put in my order there was only 1. So I dont know if there was an issue with your site but thought you might want to know. I'd put in another order for those 2 items but I dont want to pay for shipping again.

Thank you,

<PERSON>

Customer's Message: Hi!

I did place an order for the 37409 Lord <PERSON> (DCC sound) back in <DATE_TIME> (ACC-9137) and paid a £30 deposit. Later in <DATE_TIME> this order had a new order number generated (ACC-36570) and paid this in <DATE_TIME>. I did receive my loco <DATE_TIME> back with DHL express, paid the customs/VAT when it arrived in <LOCATION>, and <IN_PAN> was excellent as always with <PERSON>

But <DATE_TIME> there was a parcel at my front door, this time from Irish Railway models, with my adress on it and <IN_PAN>. This time I did not have to pay any custom fees or other import taxes, but now I got two 37409 dcc sound locos, I only ordered one and I just ""need"" one of them 😅.

What do I do now? Sending it back to the <LOCATION>/Ireland will probably be expensive but as it is a model for £200+ I think you want it back. Even tho it's is a nice model, I don't need two and ""buy one - get one free"" does not sound like a viable business model for you 😁

I've only used this a couple times as of yet, and need to work on adjusting the amount when subbing it for regular flour, but I am still so impressed. I have insulin resistance and have missed baking - save for some almond flour snacks, which are fine... but - this flour is making things feel more ""normal"" again.

The recipe has changed
I have ordered this cereal a few times. On my last ordyit was VERY clear that the recipe was changed and for me, not for the better. It is now slimy when you eat with milk or alternative. The wafer pieces are no longer crunchy and puffy, but rather chewy and flat. I had hope I just got a bad bag....but my second bag in the order was more of the same. Will not purchase again.

I understand your concern with the sensitivity of the light button on your wireless teeth whitening system.

Agent's Message: Hello <PERSON>,
Was just doing your set up and found you had already been set up in <DATE_TIME>.
You had already logged in to the wholesale portal in <DATE_TIME> as well. Now you just need to go back to the wholesale portal and log in.
To order in the future, go to the Wholesale Portal first. The wholesale portal is found under the WHOLESALE tab in the top menu bar at
<URL>
Click the portal and log in. You can always bookmark this page so you don't have to go the home page first.
The direct link is:
<URL>
When you are in the portal, you can order from <LOCATION>, Bag hardware and <PERSON> Printed patterns.
IMPORTANT:
Be careful if you click in one of the product descriptions for hardware kits or other items because the links will navigate you away from the wholesale portal and onto the regular retail site! Example, to order <PERSON>, click the Hardware Kit <IN_PAN> in the menu, do not click on the links that are in the patterns <IN_PAN> or you will go to the hardware kits that are on the retail site!
Let me know if you have any issues at all!

I tried to wait it out, as my apartment complex was investigating the lost package. But it seems like my package was indeed delivered, however was stolen. There was no photo of the package delivered in my package room and there's no video footage in the room to determine if it indeed wasn't left, or if it was and someone else took it. This hasn't happened to me before since I've lived in the complex that I am in, but I'm not sure what to do now. I figured it wouldn't hurt to reach out.

Please look for an invoice to pay that is sent separate from the order summary. Most often, it goes to a junk folder.
Thank you,

Agent's Message: Hello <PERSON>,
Sure, I have found the order and it was already packed for shipping but I pulled it back.
The fabric is already cut and packaged, but I can send you an invoice to double the order so we can ship together, but it will need to be cut in a separate piece and not one continual piece for them.  We do have enough of the flax fabric, but we only have about 1 1/4 Yards of the black. Will that be okay for you?

My order number is <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>. If it hasn't been fulfilled and shipped yet, would you be pleased be able to double the amount of each fabric and charge the same card used for the order? I would like to avoid having to place a second order if possible.

Thank you!

Thank you for reaching out to Miansai.
We received a notification from the issuing bank with a flag for fraudulent activity. Therefore our finance department closed the order and processed a refund.
If you would like to place another order, paying with PayPal would be the best way to go. For international orders please make sure to select the ship to country of destination from the “SHIP TO” flag in the lower left hand corner of the website.

Hey there

<PERSON> here from Awareness Avenue

I noticed you've shown interest in some of our lovingly crafted jewelry
pieces.

After seeing that your 20% OFF discount code expired I immediately asked
the team if we could do something about it

As someone who also cherishes the importance of meaningful symbols, I
wanted to make sure you had the chance & enough time to make the decision
you deserve!

So I was able to get a <DATE_TIME> extension on your personal code

This means you can still enjoy 20% OFF the entire store

Now's the moment to add that special piece to your collection or secure the
perfect gift, all while enjoying a significant saving.
Claim
In case you're wondering, every piece you choose comes with our Lifetime
Guarantee.

It's our promise to accompany you on your life's journey, one beautiful
symbol at a time.

As I said I was only able to get <DATE_TIME> so take your chance
for these savings and lifelong peace of mind or it will soon be a missed
opportunity.

Feel free to reply to this email if you have any questions or need further
information.

I'm here to assist you personally.

Wishing you a journey full of love, self-expression, and meaningful
connections.

Warm regards,

Here are two potential solutions:

(2) If possible, download the files onto a computer. From there, you can save your files to an online drive such as Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive. Then you can import them from the online drive to GoodNotes.
I've reset your downloads so that you can try these methods:

I received my replacement charm with a new chain after the initial one was received as damaged. My initial order was for a chain with three charms, one for each of my dogs.

I just went to put the new charm on the necklace I originally purchased, with the idea being to replace the damaged charm. I now realize that the charms cannot slide off of the necklace. I don’t understand why I was sent a replacement of only one charm when I am sure this is not new information for you guys. You should’ve sent me a completely new order.

So now I have the original necklace with three charms on it, one of which is damaged and is impossible to get off. And then a separate necklace with one of my dogs on it. What am I supposed to do with this? I was really excited for this purchase and it turns out you guys must not understand how your products work. What am I supposed to do? I think that I deserve to have a replacement chain with all three of my dogs reprinted. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with two pieces I cannot combine. As I’m sure you can see. I made my original purchase <DATE_TIME>. I am yet to have a wearable on damaged necklace with all three of my dogs on it which is what I originally purchased.

<PERSON>
""Carmen"" is an exquisite fragrance, a symphony of contrasts
where the opulence of exotic spices dances with the richness
of woodland enchantments. This scent is a masterfully
composed tapestry, beckoning you on a journey of sensory
allure that begins with a bold declaration of seductive
fruitiness, meanders through a landscape of intoxicating
florals and spices, and culminates in a resonant embrace of
deep, woody warmth.

💫 Top Note: Black Cherry Rhapsody Carmen opens with a
captivating overture of Black Cherry, a melody of dark,
luscious fruitiness that enwraps you in its voluptuous
charm. This initial encounter is both tantalizing and
inviting, blending the cherry's deep sweetness with a subtle
hint of tartness, creating an atmosphere of mystique and
anticipation.

💫 Heart Note: Spiced Floral Elegance At its heart, <PERSON>
unfurls a tapestry of exotic spices and delicate florals.
The warmth of <PERSON> and the luxurious allure of Saffron
interweave, forming an enchanting spice-laden breeze. This
spicy infusion is softened by the tender touch of
Heliotrope, a floral whisper that adds a creamy, almond-like
sweetness, balancing the intensity of the spices with its
gentle caress.

💫 Base: Woodland Resonance In its final act, <PERSON> settles
into a rich, woody base. The comforting essence of Fir
Balsam melds seamlessly with the noble strength of Cedar,
evoking the serene depth of ancient forests. This woody
foundation is elevated by the sophisticated touch of
Ambergris, adding a refined, almost marine-like elegance
that lingers on the skin, a testament to the fragrance's
enduring charm.

💫 For the Bold and the Beautiful Carmen is a fragrance for
the bold, for those who embrace the complexities of life
with passion and elegance. It is a scent that speaks to the
fearless heart, to the individual who is captivated by the
dance of contrasts, finding beauty in the blend of darkness
and light, spice and sweetness, strength and softness. With
its rich, multifaceted character, <PERSON> is more than a
fragrance; it is a declaration of confidence, a celebration
of sophistication.

Great pasta flour
The Farm Girl pasta flour allows those on keto to have pasta, so,etching forbidden with regular pasta. The flour mixes well, and cuts well using my Kitchen aid pasta machine attachmentments. For those without a machine you could just knead and follow the recipe for hand cut noodles. It is delicious, and tender and my non keto family members can’t tell the difference between my keto pasta flour and regular pasta flour.

I am really delighted with the products you have sent me. When I ordered the new collection I purchased a voucher for a full sized bottle which I understood was an additional £39.

Many thanks,

You did understand it right. Normally when you buy the Discovery Set you get a coupon for £25, but because you took advantage of this offer, you receive a £95 voucher to spend on your favourite fragrance. Therefore, the full bottle 100ml should be free for you.

Hey there,

We hope you're feeling fabulous and smelling even better
since you got your hands on the Saltworks Discovery Set. And
if you haven't yet had a chance to fully explore all the
scents, we won't tell... much.

But we do want to remind you that you've got a £25 voucher
burning a hole in your pocket, waiting to be spent on a
full-size bottle of your favourite fragrance.
Or, if you're feeling adventurous and can't pick
just one, we've got a sweet deal for you. Get 3x Travel
sized bottles for only £50! That's a steal, right?
But here's the thing, time is running out. You don't want to
miss out on this chance to smell like a million pounds
(without actually spending a million pounds, of course). So,
make your move and choose your signature scent <DATE_TIME>!

Enjoy and stay fragranced,

I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're experiencing with your sauna's steamer. To address the leak and lack of steam, please ensure that the seal around the steamer is intact and that it's filled to the recommended water level.

I have used the sauna multiple times and it has been great.  I have noticed the past couple of times I am getting little to no steam. I have set the timer to 45 and temp to 9.  I have noticed the steamer seems to be leaking more as well.  What are my options?

Thank you,
Doreen
Agent's Message: After taking a look at the second picture- I see what you mean-   The image on the site does not match the cake plate or the plate and cover set- low profile means that the plate itself does not set directly on the counter or surface- it has a low profile pedestal , not an elevated pedestal.    The set that includes the cover will have the same low profile cake plate.
It is up to you.  We can provide a return shipping label for the cake plate or you can order the cover to be used with the plate you already have.

I have a vintage Saks 5th Ave handbag that is missing a threaded link rod for one of the handles. I have included a few photos. I went to a jeweler and they were able to get some measurements for me but did not have the part. I was hoping you might stock this part.

The threaded rod measures approx, 0.10mm in diameter and about 15mm in length.

We know our product is the best in the market that will give you at least 1 shade whiter.
Please confirm by sending us a good shipping address.
Remember:
Every smile is different so some customers may require a full <DATE_TIME> session <DATE_TIME> after brushing for <DATE_TIME> straight or even longer to achieve your personal whitening goals. Other smiles will only require <DATE_TIME> of treatments to get to their desired shade.
Pro tip: try to use a straw to reduce contact with your teeth when drinking liquids. You only need to avoid staining foods and liquids for <DATE_TIME> post whitening sessions. At least while you are in <DATE_TIME> of whitening treatments. We also recommend brushing and flossing your teeth after each meal, whenever possible.

Hi <PERSON> ,

Thank you for reaching out.

Could you please try placing the defective hearing aid on a
different socket of the charger? This will help us determine
if the issue lies with the charger's socket or the hearing
aid itself.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Customer's Message: <DATE_TIME> I left it in the charger for another cycle, but it did not fully charge.
Here is what happens:

After a number of <DATE_TIME> of charging, one is charged and other
one flashes red. Then it flashes green from time to time, but it mostly flashes red. It never turns green the way the other one does. Then when I turn it on and put it in it works for a little while, then it makes a <IN_PAN> sound and then shuts off. It
is clearly not working the way it did initially and does not work the way the other one does.

Could you please confirm if both of them are turned off

that the blue light means that there is a power running

Thank you,

Customer's Message: Yes, they are both shut off. On the rare occasions that I forget to turn one of them off, it feeds back and I can hear it so I do turn it off. The thing is, one of them is clearly charged and the other one just never stops flashing and that has never been the
case.

Thanks for getting back to me.

Customer's Message: Hi <PERSON>,
Another hearing has begun to malfunction. This one started by not charging properly. One hearing aid would charge and the other one would continue to flash red. However, when I put them in they both seemed to work so I didn't think anything of it. <DATE_TIME>, it started to make a crunching noise and then it shut off. I have had to take it out. As much as I have enjoyed using these hearing aids I must say that I am disappointed. I have been very careful with them. I keep them in their holder, I keep them clean and dry and never <IN_PAN> them. Despite that, two of them have broken. You replaced the first one <DATE_TIME> but I spent a lot of money shipping it back to you. Also, you said you would send the replacement when I sent the tracking number to you but it did not ship for <DATE_TIME> after I sent the tracking number.
I don't know if there is anything you can do for me but I think I am going to try an alternative.
Regards and thanks,

Yes, by tracking number we mean the number provided by your
shipping carrier (UPS, FedEx, etc.) when you out the
package. It's important to have this number as it allows us
to track the return shipment. You can package the item in a
small
box or padded envelope.

Unfortunately, we do not provide prepaid shipping labels for
returns. Please ensure that you keep a receipt or proof of
shipment until the return process is complete.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

I am enjoying your product but unfortunately I have a problem. One of the hearing aids is malfunctioning. I am getting a crackle sound similar to a blown speaker. Then it shuts off. I think it was caused by a loud alarm that went off near where I was standing. The other one seems to be working fine. Is there a way to get one replaced? I made the original purchase at <DATE_TIME>.

Customer's Message: Hi Audien Team,
I am interested in participating in this program and believe I would be a good reviewer for your products.  I am happy with my hearing aids thus far and I have actually owned very expensive custom-fit hearing aids. I think yours are better.   However, I would like to get the Atom Pro rather than the Atom. In addition, I am happy to not take the $50 if you will allow me to upgrade for free.  One issue I have with the Atom is the feedback and I understand that the better hearing aid has less feedback. Also, the <PERSON> seems smaller than the ones I have. Let me know what you think.

Great flavor and no sweetener aftertaste!
Tried 4 different flavors of Farm Girl Cereal and they are all great tasting, no aftertaste! The fruity ones are mine and my husband's favorites, the flavor is stronger, we thought the flavor of the chocolate and honey os was amazing as a dry snack but when we added almond milk the cereal flavor wasn't as prominent. Still de-lish and we will buy them all again!

I am not sure why you might not be able to see checkout. It's possible that you need to update or change browsers. I would change browsers and see if that works better for you.
If the price is changing at checkout, I can think of two things that may be happening. You may be logged out so it's switched to retail prices, or your currency is switching to currency.  Logging in on an updated browser may also fix this.
If not,  after you do checkout, I can refund any discount that may be coming off. I think changing browsers and checking your are logged in and not getting logged out at cart is the answer.
If these solutions don' help, please send me a screen shot of your web page at checkout.

Customer's Message: <DATE_TIME>Firstly well done on some <IN_PAN> models that you’re producing.

I have 2 class 37s, firstly 37026 DCC sound direct from <PERSON> followed soon after by 37051 DCC ready and upgraded with <PERSON> sound chip.

Unfortunately I didn’t do my due diligence and research the locomotives and picked the refurbished project. It sounds awesome however it’s different to 026 and now I realise it should have the unrefurbished sound.

I have all the original packaging with no damage and was wondering if I could return it and swap it for the correct chip a unrefurbished version??

I’ve included the order number ACC-63645

Thanks

Agent's Message: Hi <PERSON>,
I'm sorry to hear the Atom Pro 2 did not meet your needs and I want to thank you for your patience so far. Please give me the opportunity to make things right for you.
We do have our
<PERSON>
, which will specifically address the exact issues you had with the Atom Pro 2. I think if we upgrade you to the BTE it will be perfect for you.
I <IN_PAN> that you might not be open to a behind the ear device, and a lot of our customers said the same thing at first, but after trying the Audien BTE they found that it actually worked better for them than in-ear devices.
The main <IN_PAN> users face with the Atom Pro 2 are solved by the BTE:
Size/fit -
If the Atom Pro 2 didn't fit comfortably in your ears, the BTE <IN_PAN> will. Since only the earbud goes in your ear canal instead of the whole unit, the BTE can fit into ears as small as a child's.
Feedback -
While the Atom Pro 2 has great sound quality, it can still have some feedback because the <IN_PAN> sits in your ear canal. With the BTE, this problem is solved because the <IN_PAN> is on the device which sits outside of the ear.
Power & sound quality -
The Audien BTE is the most powerful device we have available. If you had any problems with power or sound quality on the Atom Pro 2, the BTE will <IN_PAN> it.
<IN_PAN> -
If you're worried about how the BTE will look, it actually is more invisible when worn compared to in-ear devices. Since it fits behind your ear, it can only be seen from behind you, but when someone is looking at your face it can't be seen.
The Audien BTE typically retails for $489, however what I can do is upgrade you from your Atom Pro 2 to the BTE for only $80.
I can also give you free shipping on your upgrade, and it will include a <DATE_TIME> money back guarantee, just in case the BTE doesn't work for you.
Let me know if you'd like to try the upgrade and I could get it shipped out to you right away!

If none of the earbud sizes work for you and the hearing aids are too large, you may try them without the earbuds.

Thank you for your recent order. We appreciate your business!
We hope you'll be happy to know that all the tulip, daffodil, and allium bulbs in your order are cold hardy perennials in your area. They will return <DATE_TIME> after <DATE_TIME>! However, the Persian Buttercups (
Ranunculus asiaticus
) bulbs are not cold hardy in <NRP> planting zone 5. In cooler zones 1-7, they must be started indoors and can be moved outdoors in <DATE_TIME>. Here's how to care for them:
Plant the Ranunculus a sunny location in well-drained soil. Ranunculus loves moisture during the growing period and drier conditions as <DATE_TIME> progresses – so a spot with good drainage is a must. After the growing season ends, lift the tubers and store them in a cool, dry, dark place over <DATE_TIME>, replanting them in <DATE_TIME> after all danger of frost has passed.
We hope this information is helpful and your spring is awash in colorful blooms! Please don’t hesitate to reach out if we can be helpful.

Thank you for contacting <NRP> Meadows.
In <DATE_TIME>, the bulbs need to develop a root system before the ground freezes when the ground temperatures reach around 40° - 50°F.  These temps will signal the bulbs to grow roots, but not sprout. According to your frost dates, you usually get your first frost anywhere from <DATE_TIME>. You can also check your

","Hello <PERSON>,

Thank you for your recent order. We appreciate your business! If the ground temperature is lower than 50°F, it's best to store your bulbs in a cool, dry place until planting time. You can also consider planting them in pots indoors and then transplanting them outside when the weather warms up. 

Remember, most bulbs and rhizomes should be planted in <DATE_TIME> to early fall, when nighttime temperatures remain between 40° and 50°F or above. Soil that is around 60°F or colder is ideal for planting fall bulbs and rhizomes.

I don't mean to seem pushy, but I actually explained your
situation to my manager, and I got <IN_PAN> to give you
the Atom Pro 2 for FREE.

Even though it's free, it will extend your return window
<DATE_TIME> just in case it still doesn't work for you.

Our mission is to make hearing <IN_PAN> and <IN_PAN> for
everyone, so I just want to do <IN_PAN> in my power to get
you the help that you deserve.

Would you still like me to process your refund, or should I
get that Atom Pro 2 sent out to you right away for free?

Let me know and I'll get you taken care of.

I'm sorry to hear the Atom Pro did not meet your needs and I
want to thank you for your patience so far. Please give me
the opportunity to make things right for you.

We did just release our
Atom Pro 2
, which will specifically address the issues
you had with the Atom Pro. I think if we upgrade you to the
Atom Pro 2 it will be perfect for you.

Here are a few exciting new features of the Atom Pro 2:
*
28% smaller
*
Better <IN_PAN> noise cancellation / feedback
          reduction
*
New <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> chip for better sound quality & speech
          clarity
*
4 unique hearing modes so you can pick what works
          best for your hearing loss
*
Portable charging case w/ UV cleaning <IN_PAN>

It typically retails for $289, however what I can do is
upgrade you from your Atom to the Atom Pro 2 for only $50.

I can also give you free shipping on your upgrade, and it
will include a <DATE_TIME> money back guarantee, just in case the
Atom Pro 2 doesn't work for you.

Let me know if you'd like to try the upgrade and I could get
it shipped out to you right away!

<PERSON> Message: Hi <PERSON>
It's possible that your added items may add shipping costs due to the extra weight, so it's best for us if you place another order now. I have put a note on your first orders to hold them and combine with an additional order.
When we are shipping <DATE_TIME> (Canada Post is not picking up <DATE_TIME> due to Remembrance Day), we will see you have multiple orders, ship them together and refund any shipping charges that aren't required. This is best, since shipping rates are based on weight.  Thank you!!  Janelle

not good
this flavour is the worst one it just tastes bad.. the Cheerios and cinnamon ones are the best in my opinion. I was hoping your rainbow one was going to taste closer to Froot Loops, which is what the one does from magic spoon.

Agent's Message: Hello,
If you have tried <IN_PAN> and nothing is working for you, don't worry, we will take care of you. We would like to offer you an upgrade to our best model, Atom PRO, at the <IN_PAN> cost of only $60. It is 22% smaller than the Atom and has enhanced feedback cancellation as well as improved sound <IN_PAN> making the sound more crisp and clear. The charging case is also portable. If you allow the case to charge <DATE_TIME>, it will store the charge for about 3-4 days.
Are you <IN_PAN>?
Customer's Message: Taking the cups off made them more painful to wear. Unfortunately they have not stayed in my ear with the cups on and without them they are painful. Sound quality is not EQ'd as well as I had hoped. What other solutions do you have?
Agent's Message: Hi ,
If none of the earbud sizes work for you and the hearing aids are too large, you may try them without the earbuds. When doing this, please make sure to clean the hearing aids and replace the wax guards more regularly. Although the earbud makes the hearing aid more comfortable, it is not necessary for the hearing aids to function properly.
Customer's Message: Thanks for the tips but what is happening is they don’t seat well in my ears and when I’m greeting someone with a hug they start to feedback which is embarrassing. I might have small ear canals that cause the hearing aids to slip out. Do you have a different ear cup?
Agent's Message: If you are experiencing feedback/whistling from your hearing aids, don't worry, this is a normal <IN_PAN> when inserting them. I suggest you gently press the hearing aid deeper into your ear canal until this feedback stops. The <IN_PAN> is the cause of this sound, and once you have adjusted the hearing aid to the correct position, it should go away!
Also,
1) Feedback upon insertion is expected. It's normal to occur with in-ear devices. The main thing is that the feedback should only happen when getting the device inserted, and once it's inserted properly, there should be minimal to zero feedback.
2) Volume will affect feedback during insertion. Set the volume to level 1 before inserting to avoid it <IN_PAN>. Just hold the units close to your ears, click the buttons to set volume to live 1, and then insert them.
3) It's hard to avoid touching the <IN_PAN> when grabbing the device, and the closer your hand is to the mic, the more likely it is to cause feedback. So the best way to insert the device is by holding it by the pull wire, which is the farthest point away from the unit. Hold the unit by the pull wire, and let your fingers gently support the unit from the back, which is also the complete opposite side of the mic.
Customer's Message: Hello, I've not had good success with the in ear. I get so much feedback and they fall out of my ears. I would like to return them.

I am definitely happy with my purchase. If you are looking for feedback, the main thing I’d like to see going forward is clarity in the item description and photos regarding how large the image/heads will be. The dog heads seem to mostly fill the disk, but I purchased two with my cats heads, and I assume because of the height of their ears sticking up, their faces are really small. Mildly disappointing but I have to imagine it’s a limitation of the “printer” so that the whole image fits in the circle. I’m attaching a photo to show what I received.

Again, it looks great but I was a little confused when I opened it. I saw a recent update that you plan to implement preview images or proofs prior to purchase going forward. I think that would help a lot.

Thank you!
