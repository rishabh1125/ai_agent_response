<DATE_TIME>!
I am so sorry if you did not receive the laser engraved plates with your belt.
No worries, I will advise the team to send them asap.
Also, the football field plate is where you will be attaching the plates.
See photo for reference.
Let us know if you have any other questions.
Thank you!
Customer's Message: Hello,

I recently purchased and a belt from you guys. The product is exactly what I had hoped for quality wise, but I have a few issues with my order.

When ordering, the website asked for the league name, making me assume that the belt would be personalized. Then, I paid extra for nametags and didn't receive them. To add to that, there is no spot for said tags to be added to the belt.

I look forward to your response and hope we can discuss these concerns more.

Thank you,
<PERSON> from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone


response:
Hello <PERSON>,

I'm thrilled to hear that you're enjoying the belt! Rest assured, we're on top of getting those nameplates to you. If there's anything else you need help with, just let me know.

Warm regards,
<PERSON>

I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're experiencing with your sauna's steamer. To address the leak and lack of steam, please ensure that the seal around the steamer is intact and that it's filled to the recommended water level.

I have used the sauna multiple times and it has been great.  I have noticed the past couple of times I am getting little to no steam. I have set the timer to 45 and temp to 9.  I have noticed the steamer seems to be leaking more as well.  What are my options?

Hello <PERSON>,
Thank you for reaching out to PetLab Co. customer care.
We're sorry that your pup isn't too fond of the chews. We <IN_PAN> how frustrating it can be when our furry friends won't be able to take what we offer them. 😔
Have you tried giving the chews with something your pup already enjoys? This can make it much more appealing. Many customers have found that using dog-friendly peanut butter, cheese, or yogurt has helped get their pups to take their supplements regularly.
Of course, please remember to be mindful of any sensitivities your pup may have. We'd love for you to give it a try and let us know if it makes a <IN_PAN>.
Nevertheless, I can confirm that your subscriptions has been canceled and you can be certain that you will no longer be charged for, or receive future orders.
On another note, I want to let you know that your recent order is already in transit under tracking number

In the meantime, If you think of anything else that you need assistance, please let us know. We are always glad to help.

Agent's Message: Hello Konstantina,
Thank you for <IN_PAN> us regarding your order #JHLA27975.
We just checked your tracking information (
<URL>)
and we can see that your parcel has been cleared by the <NRP> customs services on <DATE_TIME> and is now on its way to you. After being customs cleared, the parcel is handed over to a different carrier so that the parcel can transit from the <LOCATION> to <LOCATION>. These updates don't always show on the tracking information as it is neither the original carrier nor the final one from the destination country, so you might not see any new update for <DATE_TIME>.
As it is a long way to <LOCATION>, it usually takes some time for parcels going to <LOCATION> to show new updates as it has to reach your country, be handled by your country customs services and then be handed over to the final carrier.
In your country, your parcel will be handled by ACS. You'll be able to track it through this link:
<URL>
.
We will keep an eye on the tracking to make sure the parcel travels smoothly to you. We hope that you will be satisfied with your pair of <PERSON>!
We remain at your disposal for any questions.

response:
Hello <PERSON>,

Thank you for your previous order. We appreciate your business! After broadcasting the seeds, there's no need to water them in if you're planting after a hard frost. The seeds will lay dormant over <DATE_TIME> and germinate <DATE_TIME> when soil temperatures warm up.

In <DATE_TIME>, keep the soil moist until seedlings are about 6" tall (about 4-6 weeks). Initially, seedlings need regular rainfall or watering to establish the deep roots needed to become drought-tolerant.

Thanks,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is <PERSON>, and I represent agood company. I trust you are having <DATE_TIME>.
I'd like to extend our sincerest apologies for the confusion you encountered while browsing our website. My colleague <NRP> has delegated your inquiry to me, and I am here to assist you to the best of my abilities.
Regarding your recent purchase, I want to assure you that the iPhone 12 Pro case you ordered is indeed compatible with Apple's <PERSON>. This means you can continue using your <NRP> charger with the case on your phone, and it will charge your device. The only distinction is that it won't magnetically attach, unlike our iPhone 14 cases and newer models equipped with a MagSafe Ring that can be bought separately. I apologize for any confusion, and I hope this clarifies the situation.
Furthermore, as a gesture of goodwill, we would like to offer you a 50% refund on your purchase without requiring you to return the product. If you encounter any other issues with the product, please don't hesitate to reach out, and we will be more than happy to arrange a replacement for you. How does that sound?
We greatly appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter. Your satisfaction is of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to making it right.
Hoping for your kind consideration 🙏

Customer's Message: I done all that and chained the filter too but still not getting sound out the left hearing aid.  Both lights interaction say both are fully charged / we’ll go though it all again and see what happen.   Thank for the tips
Agent's Message: If your hearing aids are not charging, it may be time to clean them. To do this, you will want the hearing aids, charger, cleaning brush and a soft cloth or tissue.
First, clean your hearing aids with the small brush, getting inside both the receiver (the side that goes into the ear canal) and the <IN_PAN> (the side that faces out of the ear). Move onto the charger and clean out both charging ports with the brush to break up any dirt or debris.
Now that you have brushed away excess dirt, use the soft cloth to wipe down the body of the Audien BTE . This includes the push buttons, charging contacts, and the shell of the device. However, it's important to avoid using any cleaning solvents such as alcohol or water, as these can cause damage to the device.
Extreme temperatures or exposure to foreign <IN_PAN> can also damage the Audien BTE, so it's important to handle the device with care.
After you have finished cleaning, charge your Audien BTE. It should take between <DATE_TIME> for the units to fully charge.
If your Audien BTE is still not charging, please reach out to us!

Thank you for the delivery of our pendant light. We recently had our electricians unbox and install the pendant light. I am really love the pendant light however I noticed part of it is discoloured/has a line through it on one side
which to me is unfortunately very noticeable.
I checked the box that it came in and there is nothing wrong with the box which could have caused this discolouration.

Please find attached photos which the concern I have. It is only on half of it any the other side is a clean shade of white.

agent_response:
Hi <PERSON>,
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I am sorry to hear of the concern you have mentioned.
These stunning Villa Pendants are hand made and painted, which do allow for some slight differences aesthetically.
The fact that the light has been installed with this issue, makes it slightly harder to resolve. As our policy states on the product page and our website, to "Please inspect all lighting fixtures for any cosmetic imperfections before installing and disposing of the products packaging." It is unfortunate that your electrician has installed the light prior to a thorough inspection.
In this case, I do believe a slight paint touch up will be able to resolve this issue easily, as it is a very faint line, almost unnoticeable thankfully! Due to this, we would love to go outside of our policy and offer you a partial refund of $30 to cover the cost a light paint touch up.
Once confirmed by yourself, I can process the refund straight away. Please let me know if you have any questions. :)

Agent's Message: Hi <PERSON>
We have received your query. One of our team member will get back to you shortly.
Customer's Message: What is the brush for and how do I know I need to use it?


response:
Apologies for the wait. The brush tool is designed to help with precise application and blending of products to achieve a professional finish. It's particularly useful if you're looking to add volume or detail in specific areas. You'll know you need to use it when you require more control over your styling or makeup application.

Best regards,
<PERSON>

agent_response:
Hi <PERSON>,
The brush is used to keep the hearing aids clean, which is essential for their performance and longevity. If you notice any debris or earwax on your hearing aids, it's time to use the brush. Please let me know if you need further assistance.
Best regards,
<PERSON>

I just received my trophy and base, however there is no apparent way to attach the trophy to the base. I was given the trophy head, the base and a bolt. The base does not have threads nor a slot for the bolt head to enter. Please advise as to how I’m supposed
to mount the trophy. Thank you


response:
Hello <PERSON>,

Thank you for your email. There should be a 4.5" screw bolt included with your 15" Perpetual Fantasy Football Trophy - Gold Football. This is needed to attach the topper to the trophy base.

If you're still having trouble, could you please send us a photo of the issue? We'll forward it to our production team and request a replacement if necessary.

Thank you and we apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Agent's Message: Sure! In case you want to proceed with the exchange, the bed you have at home would be picked up and return to us at the time the new one is delivered.
Please for either case, I need you to provide pictures of the bed you have in your home in order to know its condition.
Customer's Message: Thank you for <IN_PAN>! The headboard is so much shorter than I expected it to be -- it was hard to tell from photos.

Agent's Message: Hi <PERSON>,
Sorry to hear you are not happy with the bed. Could you please tell me the reason why? Would you be open to another alternative?
In case you decide to return the bed, there is a 20% <IN_PAN> fee and the shipping cost is not <IN_PAN>. Alternatively, if you exchange the bed, you will only be charged the new shipping fee and the <IN_PAN> in price, not the <IN_PAN> fee. You can check more details here

Agent's Message: Hello,
Thank you for reaching out to us, and apologies for the inconvenience you're experiencing with the website redirect. We do have separate websites for different regions due to variations in product availability and shipping logistics. If you are currently in <LOCATION> and wish to access trousers available in the <LOCATION> or <LOCATION>, please try accessing the specific site you're interested in by using the following links:
For <LOCATION>:
<URL>
For the <LOCATION>:

These links should directly take you to the respective regional sites, where you can explore and purchase the trousers you're interested in. If you encounter any further issues or need assistance, please let us know. We appreciate your understanding and feedback!

Customer's Message: I am trying to access the <LOCATION> site as I am based in <LOCATION> and <LOCATION> and you have trousers there that i am interested in buying, but your website is so clever because I am in <LOCATION>, i am automatically redirected to the <LOCATION> website where you only have shorts.
most websites allow you to change location as they realise people often travel...
Can i suggest that you do the same as i cant buy your product despite being in <LOCATION> and I cant be the only one


response:
Dear <PERSON>,

I apologize for the inconvenience. Our website does default to the region based on your IP address. As a workaround, you can use a VPN set to the <LOCATION> or <LOCATION> to access the desired regional site. Alternatively, if you provide me with the items you wish to purchase and your address, I can manually place the order for you.

Best regards,

Hello <PERSON>,
Thank you so much for your interest in our products. We want to make MR MARVIS available as widely as possible, and we are delighted to hear from <LOCATION> customers such as yourself who are keen for us to provide a fuller range of products to the <LOCATION> market.
Unfortunately, we are currently unable to provide a workaround for you to order outside of our website. This is because all of our systems, including our logistics center, are set up to exclusively ship the items that are currently available online to the <LOCATION> (which includes our Original and Piqué shorts as well as our various Swims).
We'd also like to let you know that we will expand our product offering for the <LOCATION> market on our website in the future, however, we do not have a concrete timeline to share at this point. Since such changes are big, strategic decisions, these can unfortunately take a bit of time.
At the moment it is not possible to order from the <LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> for example, maybe you can use a VPN but I'm not sure if this works.
We do hope to welcome you back to one of our stores shortly and if you subscribe to our newsletter, you will of course be one of the first to know of any product expansion!
Wishing you a lovely day and sending kind regards from <LOCATION> 🌷

Agent's Message: Hi joan,
I'm sorry to hear the Atom Pro did not meet your needs and I want to thank you for your patience so far. Please give me the opportunity to make things right for you.
We did just release our
Atom Pro 2
, which will specifically address the issues you had with the Atom Pro. I think if we upgrade you to the Atom Pro 2 it will be perfect for you.
Here are a few exciting new features of the Atom Pro 2:
28% smaller
Better <IN_PAN> noise cancellation / feedback reduction
New <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> chip for better sound quality & speech clarity
4 unique hearing modes so you can pick what works best for your hearing loss
Portable charging case w/ UV cleaning <IN_PAN>
It typically retails for $289, however what I can do is upgrade you from your Atom to the Atom Pro 2 for only $50.
I can also give you free shipping on your upgrade, and it will include a <DATE_TIME> money back guarantee, just in case the Atom Pro 2 doesn't work for you.
Let me know if you'd like to try the upgrade and I could get it shipped out to you right away!

Agent's Message: If none of the earbud sizes work for you and the hearing aids are too large, you may try them without the earbuds. When doing this, please make sure to clean the hearing aids and replace the wax guards more regularly. Although the earbud makes the hearing aid more comfortable, it is not necessary for the hearing aids to function properly.

Agent's Message: Hi Ed,
Did you mean that items are damaged in your order?
If you have already provided the order number and the damaged item details, please send along a photo <IN_PAN> the issue and a photo of the tongue tag (for closed-toed shoes), and we can proceed with the next steps.
If this auto-response did not answer your question, just reply to this email with a "hi". One of our support team members will address your query.
Customer's Message: HI,

I recently purchased the below items and I started wearing the ASPH shoe and they fit perfectly! (Size 9).. LOVE them..

I therefore assumed that all the other shoes (size 9) would fit the same as the website says "We recommend ordering your usual size” across all the hose I purchased below.  When I tried on all the shoes they all seem to fit like the ASPH.. except… .the
Black "HFS II”.   the right  shoe seemed tighter than the left… but then I wiggled around in them a bit.. and took off my socks and they seemed “ok”… is this part of the <IN_PAN> to “barefoot”, etc?

I then (probably <IN_PAN>) went on a 6mile walk.. and about mile 5 my big toe was starting to hurt on the top (like where the nail is). … I’m wondering if it’s possible that the shoe is maybe defective and the right one is a bit smaller?..

I've not worn any of the others out side yet, and now I’m wondering if I need 9 1/2 instead of just 9?  Is what I describe a normal <IN_PAN>?

I have the size 9 ASPH on now with a thin sock and have been wearing them <DATE_TIME> at work with no issue…

Any guidance appreciated

response:
<PERSON>,

Thank you for reaching out. If you decide to go up half a size, keep in mind that you'll gain at least 1/4" of space in length. It's possible that the discomfort you're experiencing is part of the adjustment to barefoot shoes, but it could also be due to a sizing issue. 

If the size 9 ASPH fits well with no issues, it might be worth trying a 9.5 in <LOCATION> for comparison. We do offer free exchanges if you need to swap them out.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Best,
<PERSON>

agent_response:
Hi <PERSON>,
Thank you for reaching out.
We are sorry to hear that <LOCATION> was not a perfect fit.
In this instance, we suggest trying the shoes without the removable insoles. This generally provides enough room for most customers' comfort. :)

Agent's Message: Hello <PERSON>,
Would you mind elaborating more on your question so that we can assist you further? What refund are you expecting or referring to?
According to our records, you have returned your hearing aids for an upgrade to the Atom Pro 2 for only $40 extra. You did return the two Atom hearing aids, and in exchange, you have received the Atom Pro 2 hearing aids for only $40 (instead of paying $289).
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Sincerely,

Dear <PERSON>:
   I have been waiting since <PERSON> for my refund of the (2) pairs of hearing aids
   Which did not work for me.         This is a very long long time which is totally unacceptable.    This was all purchased on your order # <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> for $199,98

   Please credit my American Express for this amount.
   My next move will be to contact the Attorney General’s office.      Don’t think you want me to go in that direction.
   Would like to hear by <DATE_TIME>.
   Thank you
   <PERSON>

response:
Hello <PERSON>,

I'm truly sorry to hear about the feedback issues with your hearing aids. I've initiated the refund to your American Express card. You should see the credit of $40 shortly. If there's anything else I can do for you, please let me know.

Best regards,

Hello <PERSON>,
Thank you for your response.
I am happy to help you eliminate any whistling or feedback you are experiencing when using your hearing aids.
It is actually totally normal to experience some whistling when inserting the hearing aids into your ears. Once the hearing aids are properly positioned in your ear canal, the feedback should go away.
Take the hearing aids and slowly place them in your ears. Can you tell me when you experience whistling? Is it when you are inserting them into your ears? Does the whistling continue once they are fully inside your ear?
Regards,
Jose

If it’s running late, I need it in hand in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION> by <DATE_TIME> on <DATE_TIME>.

Context:Customer's Message: Hi,
I recently bought the women’s <PERSON> neo in size 8 and they are comfortable without socks. They are tight with socks, even with the sole taken out.

I’m considering the <NRP> and was wondering if it would be advisable to size up, being that I will be wearing socks. Would 8.5 or 9 be better?

Thank you.

<PERSON>


response:
Greetings <PERSON>,

Thank you for reaching out! If the Prio Neo in size 8 is snug with socks, I would recommend trying a size 8.5 in the <NRP> for a more comfortable fit with socks. Our shoes typically run true to size, but if you plan to wear thicker socks or prefer extra room, sizing up half a size can be beneficial.

Best regards,
<PERSON>

agent_response:
Greetings <PERSON>,
Thank you for reaching out!
If the Prio Neo size 8 is snug with socks, I'd recommend trying a size 8.5 in the <NRP> for a more comfortable fit with socks.
For fit, we typically recommend having about a thumb's width from your big toe/longest toe to the end of the shoe. From there personal preference comes into play if you prefer a tighter or looser fit. Depending on how much extra space you need you may want to increase at least a half size. If your toes are just touching the ends, we typically recommend ordering a half-size larger. For every half size you increase or decrease in our shoes you will gain or lose about 1/4 of an inch in length and about 1/8th of an inch in width.
Our exchange policy covers new and unworn shoes if you need to adjust the size after trying them on.
I hope this helps!

I’m sadly so disappointed with my purchase. The fragrance is so light and does not last on me. I have tried each of the samples and nothing stands out as fantastic or my kind of scent I’m really sorry as I’ve wanted to purchase these for so long. Your marketing is excellent and having been in the cosmetics industry my entire working life, which is a loooong time I  was really impressed. However I’ve been left hugely dissatisfied and disappointed Am I able to return the remaining products for a refund?Sincerely <PERSON>

Hi <PERSON>,

I'm truly sorry to hear that the fragrances did not meet your expectations. We understand the importance of finding the perfect scent and we apologize for any disappointment caused. Yes, you can return the remaining products for a refund. I will send you a return label shortly.

agent_response:
Good <DATE_TIME>.
We are sorry that our product did not meet your expectations.  All our perfumes are made using high-quality ingredients to ensure maximum durability.  The oils we use are sourced in <LOCATION>, <LOCATION>, which is the birthplace of perfume.  These are premium products.  All our perfumes are actually Extrait de Parfum because they have the highest concentration of natural oils on the market - 25%.  For perfumes to last a long time, apart from how they are created and what they contain, they also need appropriate conditions to maintain this durability.  It depends on many factors.  The most important thing is the pH of the skin, whether it is dry or moisturized.  Some diseases mean that perfumes do not last long, such as hypothyroidism or low blood pressure.  In addition, the ambient temperature and the method of storing perfume are also important.  The fragrances included in the Discovery set have the most persistent fragrance notes of all our sets: musk, amber and oud, which are considered the strongest of all those available on the perfume market.  Referring to your question about the possibility of a refund, unfortunately this is not possible.  We cannot refund products that have been used.  The return policy applies to the product remaining in the same condition as it was when purchased.
We are sorry for any inconvenience.
Kind regards,
<PERSON>

Customer's Message: I done all that and chained the filter too but still not getting sound out the left hearing aid.  Both lights interaction say both are fully charged / we’ll go though it all again and see what happen.   Thank for the tips
Agent's Message: If your hearing aids are not charging, it may be time to clean them. To do this, you will want the hearing aids, charger, cleaning brush and a soft cloth or tissue.
First, clean your hearing aids with the small brush, getting inside both the receiver (the side that goes into the ear canal) and the <IN_PAN> (the side that faces out of the ear). Move onto the charger and clean out both charging ports with the brush to break up any dirt or debris.
Now that you have brushed away excess dirt, use the soft cloth to wipe down the body of the Audien BTE . This includes the push buttons, charging contacts, and the shell of the device. However, it's important to avoid using any cleaning solvents such as alcohol or water, as these can cause damage to the device.
Extreme temperatures or exposure to foreign <IN_PAN> can also damage the Audien BTE, so it's important to handle the device with care.
After you have finished cleaning, charge your Audien BTE. It should take between <DATE_TIME> for the units to fully charge.
If your Audien BTE is still not charging, please reach out to us!
