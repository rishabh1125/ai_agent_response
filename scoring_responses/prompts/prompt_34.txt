I was looking at an email that said this Fidget ring which was showing at $49 was 50% off and when I looked at it, it was nearly $99 and now is $200\u2026\u2026\u2026.(I don\u2019t have the exact dollars and cents).  What?  This doesn\u2019t make sense.  I just went back to look at the exact price and now it is twice as much!\n   Make up your mind please!  In the meantime I have lost confidence in this company and won\u2019t be ordering anything. Was going to order a fidget ring and opal earrings,\u2026\u2026 oh well. Not comfortable ordering again from a company that keeps changing prices. Too bad cause I was pleased with my previous purchase.\n", "response": "Dear <PERSON>,\n\nI'm sorry for the confusion about the pricing. I understand how this can be frustrating.
