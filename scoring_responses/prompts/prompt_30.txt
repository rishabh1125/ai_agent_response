Is this normal? Does it get better at some point? Or is the butyrate not the right supplement for me? Or do I need to combine it with something else? Do you have a specific regimen that you recommend to combat constipation?\n\nThanks\nKatie\n", "response": "Hello <PERSON>,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your discomfort. It's not uncommon for changes in gut health to cause temporary issues as your body adjusts. For some, it takes <DATE_TIME> to see improvement.
