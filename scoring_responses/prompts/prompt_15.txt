{"prev_context": "Customer's Message: Hi,\n\nORDER #54675\n\nUnfortunately this order was left on my doorstep\u00a0in the blazing heat so the ice packs had melted by the time I\u00a0got home & it was warm - it all went in the <PERSON>, so I am not able to complete the survey as I didnt get to try any of it..\n\n<PERSON>\n<LOCATION>\n", "response": "Morning Andrea, \n\nI'm so sorry to hear the contents of your order were not chilled. Unfortunately, our last delivery for <DATE_TIME> left our kitchen late <DATE_TIME>. Our next delivery date is <DATE_TIME>, we deliver <DATE_TIME>. \n\nIf you would like me to arrange delivery of a new order to arrive with you <DATE_TIME> please let me know. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience caused, I wish I could have been more helpful.\n\nBest wishes,\n<PERSON>", "agent_response": "Hi <PERSON>,\nFirstly I would like to apologise for the delay in my reply to your email, I thought I had responded and upon checking for your reply can see that my response is unsent.\nI am ever so sorry to hear the contents of your order were spoilt and not chilled enough for consumption. I have looked into this order/delivery and can see that there have been no 'safe place' instructions provided when placing this order, therefore the courier has left the parcel at the door or in a place they deem safe.\nLooking over your past orders I can see you have provided 'Front Porch' as a safe place instruction, would you like me to add this to your profile for future orders?\nIf you don't already have the DPD app downloaded for your deliveries we highly recommend it. You can add your what3word location and other useful information such as safe place delivery instructions for the courier to ensure successful delivery.\nI would like to offer you a full refund for this order as a goodwill gesture and an apology for my late response to your email.\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\nBest wishes,\n<PERSON>"}
