The 8.5s were too small so I packaged them up and dropped them off with FedEx using a shipping label you provided. They were given to FedEx on <DATE_TIME>. Unfortunately I did not make note of the tracking number and I have not seen any credit to my account. Would you be able to provide the status of that return?
