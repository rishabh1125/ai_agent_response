I received this shipment and everything was there but the trophy was damaged. I did get the engravements and board and they were fine but the football part of the trophy was completely broke off. I\u2019m attaching a picture so you can see it. I also still have the paperwork and I guess you can see which order it was from the subject line of this email. Let me know please if I can get a replacement or if there is anything else I need to do/provide. Myself and my league mates were very excited as this was our first time purchasing from trophy smack and first time getting a trophy.\n\nThank you\n", "response": "Hello <LOCATION>,\n\nThank you for your email and for letting us know.
