{"prev_context": "Customer's Message: <PERSON>,\n\nThanks to your information, I contacted DHL and they processed a full refund of the duty and tax\n\nI wouldn't have requested it without the information you gave me.\n\nGreat service, I appreciate your help\n\nAnd by the way, the shoes are amazing\n\nThanks a lot,\n<PERSON>\nCustomer's Message: Hi <PERSON>,\n\nOh, this would make a difference\n\nYes, I paid duty fees through DHL & Canada Post\n\nAre you aware if there is a way to claim DHL?\n\nThanks,\n<PERSON>\nAgent's Message: Hello <PERSON>\nThank you for contacting us.\nWe are sorry to hear about the additional cost with your order. Duty fees are based on a percentage of the purchase price, and we are required by law to declare the total value for customs. It is at the discretion of each country to establish their rates and fees.\nFor all international orders our website has a notification during checkout that informs customers of potential customs charges. This notification pops up once a <NRP> address is entered into the 'shipping' field. If you are using a <LOCATION> based IP address, VPN, or mobile device for purchasing then this notice may not appear.\nWe also have a notice under our shipping page as well.\n<URL>\nHowever, DHL has recently alerted us that they experienced an issue with their vendor, which might have caused the proposed double payment. You should only be paying for the duty fee from Canada Poste.\nDid you pay for the duty fee through DHL?\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.\nCustomer's Message: Good <DATE_TIME>,\n\nI just wanted to share with you my experience with my order of Xero Shoes.\n\nI'm from <LOCATION> and I've ordered two pairs on your website.\n\nI thought it was in CAD$. It was in USD$,\nmy mistake.\nThen, I received a message from DHL to pay Duty and Taxes\n93.71$CAD that wasn't planned.\n\nThen, I received a message from Poste Canada to pay more Duty and Taxes?\n66.73$CAD that wasn't planned.\n\nWith the exchange rate, the shoes cost me\n422.11$CAD\u00a0+ 93.71$\u00a0+ 66.73\n=582.55$CAD\nIn the checkout menu, nothing says the price is in USD.\nI buy from the <LOCATION> all the time and it's the first time I get to pay so much duties and taxes.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to let you know.\n\nBye,\n<PERSON>\n", "response": "Hi <PERSON>,\n\nI'm glad to hear that you were able to get a refund from DHL and that you're enjoying your new shoes!
