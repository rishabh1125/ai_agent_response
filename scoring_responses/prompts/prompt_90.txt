{"prev_context": "Customer's Message: <PERSON>,\n\nThis is extremely appreciated! Thank you so much!\n\nI\u2019d love to send you some coffee as a thank you, if you/your team drink coffee. I work for Big Island Coffee Roasters, and have access to some <NRP> grown coffee, if you are <IN_PAN>! Let me know.\n\nEither way, thank you once again, and I'll send back the original shoes <DATE_TIME>!\n\n<PERSON> Message: Hello <PERSON>,\nThank you for reaching back out.\nWe have attached a return label as a one-time customer courtesy.\nPlease make sure to generate return labels with haste in the future.\nWe have also refunded the sale price match on your new order, you will receive a confirmation email with more details.\nLet us know if you have any questions.\nOrder - <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> / <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>\nCustomer's Message: Hi there,\n\nI finally got the chance to place a replacement order for the larger size, but after trying to generate a return label for the original order, I realized I am outside of the allowed return window! Is there any chance it's possible to still do the return? I\u2019m so sorry for going outside the allowed time, I <IN_PAN> lost track of the timing since I was waiting for a paycheck to be able to buy the replacement size. I must have been counting from <DATE_TIME> I received them rather than when the order was placed, <IN_PAN> my mistake, and quite a dumb one at that.\n\nLet me know if there\u2019s any chance for a <IN_PAN>. The shoes from this original order have been in the original box in my closet and not worn at all since the one time I tried them on after they first arrived.\n\nAlso, the replacement order number is #<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n<PERSON> Message: Hello <PERSON>,\nThank you for <IN_PAN> us!\nOur exchange process involves two separate transactions:\nPlace a new order for the replacement items.\nReturn the item(s) you want to exchange using the instructions below.\n****For items purchased during a sale that is no longer happening, please let us know after your new order has been placed, so that we can honor the sale pricing with a price <IN_PAN> refund.\nTo send your original order back for a full refund (including your original shipping cost), please generate a free prepaid return label here:\n<URL>\nPlease be sure to include your original packing slip and write the order number from your new purchase on it so we know this is an exchange. If you do not have your packing slip, then please include a piece of paper with your name, original order number, new order number, and the item(s) you are returning.\nIf you do not include your packing slip, then we may not be able to locate your order, which could result in a delay with your refund.\nWe process all returns in the order that they are received and kindly ask for <DATE_TIME> (from <DATE_TIME> they are received) to complete them.\nYou will receive an email confirmation once your request has been processed.\nIf you do not want to place a new order for your return, then please follow the above steps to send your shoes back to us for 100% store credit (including shipping). Include your packing slip and indicate that you would like store credit. Once the store credit is issued, you can use it instantly to purchase your new pair.\nIn order to reduce damage on shipments, FedEx is enforcing stricter protocol on how boxes are packaged. You will need to place your shoe box(es) in an <IN_PAN> box that's in good condition OR use an undamaged poly bag. They will not accept plain shoe boxes that are taped shut, nor will they accept packages that have any type of brown wrapping. Please note that if your shoes are not properly packaged, FedEx may require you to purchase a new shipping box at their retail location.\nHopefully that helps! Let us know if you have any other questions.\nCustomer's Message: Hi there,\n\nFollowing up again, as I still have not gotten a response and am getting close to that <DATE_TIME> cutoff - can you please let me know how I can exchange my ordered shoes for a half size larger? Unfortunately buying another pair is not in my budget, so I\u2019m happy to return these and get them switched out once you receive them on your end. Let me know what the best way is to proceed, whether you provide a return shipping label, or if I need to do so.\n\nThank you!\n\n<PERSON>\nCustomer's Message: Hi again!\n\nFollowing up one more time as it\u2019s been <DATE_TIME> since my original email. Could you please instruct me on how to do an exchange for a larger size? I didn't create an account when making my purchase, so I can\u2019t do this on my own through your website.\n\nThanks!\n\n<PERSON> Message: Customer Conversation\n\nHi <PERSON>\n\nThank you for <IN_PAN> Xero Shoes!\n\nWe respond to most emails\nwithin 1-2 business days; however, due to the recent sale, we are experiencing delays in our response time.\nPlease know we are working as fast as we can get back to you!
