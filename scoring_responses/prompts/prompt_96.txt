One of our team members will get back to you shortly.\nCustomer's Message: Hi.\nI ordered and received the redwood tote kit. I was getting ready to cut and noticed there was no medium weight interfacing but seems to be enough light weight to cover the medium and light cuts, if I\u2019m careful. The piece is labeled one yard and measures 36x44.\nIs it ok to use the light weight in place of the medium or was there an error in the kit?\nThanks for your help!\n<PERSON>\n", "response": "Hi <PERSON>,\n\nI'm sorry for the confusion. There seems to have been an error in your Redwood Tote Kit. The kit should indeed include medium weight interfacing. We apologize for this oversight and appreciate your understanding.\n\nWe will send out the correct interfacing to you right away. In the meantime, please feel free to use the light weight interfacing if you prefer not to wait.\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention and we hope you enjoy making your Redwood Tote!\n\nBest,\nundefined undefined", "agent_response": "Hi <PERSON>,\nI'm sorry for the confusion.
