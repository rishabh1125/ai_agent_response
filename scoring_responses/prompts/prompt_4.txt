{"prev_context": "Customer's Message: Your business has dealt very unprofessional. To always send an email that says you have a high volume means you do not manage time well. I should have had a response sooner regarding an error on your system. I adjusted my delivery date and should not have been charged for <DATE_TIME>. We already had extra. The package is now arriving. If you can get packages out that quickly, you can respond faster. I have canceled all my subscriptions.\n\n<PERSON> Message: Hey, Pet Parent!\nWe have received your message. Our dedicated Customer Care team will get back to you as soon as they can! \ud83d\udc36\nDue to a high volume of requests, we are seeing longer response times. Please do not send multiple requests as this may slow our response time. In the meantime, many common questions can be answered on our\nHelp Center\n.\nWe look forward to assisting you!\n\ud83d\udc3e Stay pawsome,\nPetLab Co.\nCustomer's Message: I received my typical email letting me know my subscription would be sent soon and to make any changes needed. I did just that <IN_PAN> the next shipment to come on <DATE_TIME> instead of <DATE_TIME>. I saved it and it said next shipment was <DATE_TIME>. I have a notification that my card was charged and a shipment coming. I have too much product and did not want it to charge my card <DATE_TIME>. I\u2019m not looking to cancel, but if I can\u2019t trust that it will send when I\u2019ve requested then I will need to cancel and find another company. I utilize subscriptions all the time and have never had an issue with <IN_PAN> shipments. I would prefer to not be sent product and my card refunded.\n\nReason For Contact: order_issue\n\nName: <PERSON>\n\nOrder Id: <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>\n\nZip Code: 30126\n\nEmail: <EMAIL_ADDRESS>\n\nGEO: usa\n", "response": "<PERSON>,\n\nI apologize for the delayed response and any inconvenience caused by the charge error. It's clear we've fallen short in managing your subscription preferences, and I'm truly sorry. I've initiated a full refund for the unwanted shipment and will ensure your subscriptions are canceled as requested. Your satisfaction is crucial to us, and we'll strive to improve our response times.\n\nWarm regards,\n<PERSON>", "agent_response": "<PERSON>,\nI apologize for the delayed response and any inconvenience caused by the charge error. It's clear we've fallen short in managing response times, and we're truly sorry.\nYour satisfaction is crucial to us, and we'll strive to improve on all fronts.\nGiven the situation, I want to offer you a 50% immediate refund for the order or $82.91. You don't have to send the products back and may keep them for future use at half the cost. However, do let me know if you'd prefer to return it for a full refund.\nCan you confirm that you were able to change the delivery date to <DATE_TIME> for all of the subscriptions listed? I dug into this and found that only the Allergy Chews-small was scheduled for <DATE_TIME>. If you've noticed, this product is not included in this most recent order. All the other products however remained to be scheduled for <DATE_TIME>, and this is probably why they were processed <DATE_TIME>.\nIf you can confirm that the change of delivery date was made for all products, then it is a possible glitch in our system, and we want to isolate this issue and fix it ASAP. Your input is most valuable.\nThanks again, and sorry for the inconvenience caused.\nStay pawsome,\n<PERSON>"}
