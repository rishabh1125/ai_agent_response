One of our team members will get back to you shortly.\nCustomer's Message: Hi!\n\nLove your <PERSON> fabric! But have had many customers request it in black. Any chance of it ever being available in black?\n\nThe charcoal is not quite black enough. I do not resell - but do make purses with it!\n\nThanks!\n<PERSON>\n", "response": "Hello <PERSON>,\n\nWe do not have <PERSON> in a dark black, as of yet, we do sell it in Charcoal. We do have a dark black in the <PERSON> line though. I hope that helps!\n\nBest,\nJanelle", "agent_response": "Hello <PERSON>,\nI know what you mean! Unfortunately, we cannot make it in black, although we have tried to get samples done in black. The process and softness of it, creates a faded look. I am sorry, I wish it was darker too. I may try again with the samples to see if we can get it close. Thank you for your inquiry!!\nJanelle"}
