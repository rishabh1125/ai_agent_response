Cravings can be complex, influenced by various factors including diet, stress, and gut health. If you're starting antibiotics for SIBO, it's important to discuss supplement use with your healthcare provider to ensure they complement your treatment plan.\n\nWarm regards,\n<PERSON>", "agent_response": "Hi <PERSON>,\nThank you for reaching out. It's unlikely that butyrate supplements would cause sugar cravings. Cravings can be complex, influenced by various factors including diet, stress, and gut health. SIBO itself could result in cravings as the bad bugs that are hanging out in your gut could be signaling for an increase in sugar to feed the bad bugs. If you're starting antibiotics for SIBO, it's important to discuss supplement use with your healthcare provider to ensure they complement your treatment plan.\nI hope this helps, <PERSON>.
