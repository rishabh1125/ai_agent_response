{"prev_context": "Agent's Message: Hi yugrail\nThank you for contacting Xero Shoes!\nOur average response time is 2-3 business days.\nPlease know we are working as fast as we can get back to you!\nIf you have an\nurgent request\nregarding your order (such as an\naddress change\nor\norder cancellation\n), please email <EMAIL_ADDRESS> with the headline \"\nUrgent Order Update,\n\" we'll do our very best to fix it before it goes out.\nPlease keep in mind that we\nmay be unable to\nmake any changes once an order has been placed.\nThank you!\nCustomer's Message: Hey\u00a0Xero Shoes team,\nI wanted to share my feedback on returning shoes that didn't fit. In a nutshell, it was pretty bad compared to the experience I had with\u00a0Olukai, another shoe company. Here's the process for xero shoes:\n- Print a label.\n- If you don't have a printer, go to fedex.\n- They ask you to send an email with the label received from xero shoes to their email address\n- They then ask you to go to one of their printers to print the label. You have to pay for it.\n- They then asked me to buy a box that they charged me $7.99 for.\n- They then packaged it and kept it for returning to xero\n\nQuite a painful\u00a0experience. Compare this with the experience with Olukai shoes. Here's what I had to do:\n- They sent a QR code when I submitted my return request online.\n- I went to a UPS store with the shoe box. They took the shoe box, scanned the\u00a0QR code I had and gave me a receipt.\n- $0 cost and 0 hassle for me\n- They used some company called Happy returns to handle the returns\n\nI would highly recommend you changing your process or you will lose customers. I am not sure I want to deal with this return process with <PERSON> again and for that reason may not buy again. Thought I would share my feedback.\n\nThanks,\n<PERSON>\n", "response": "Hello <PERSON>,\n\nThank you for your honest feedback.
